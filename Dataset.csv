I recently went through a breakup and she said she still wants to be friends so I said I can try doing that but when she talks to me about things it always hurts. I just want to lose feelings so all this pain can stop it hurts so much and I cannot even cry about it. I do not want to hurt her because she said she does not want to never speak to me again but I do not know what to do here. When we were together she always hurt me so I do not know why I still love her. I wish we never met it would be much less painful How do I lose feelings?,Depression
"I do not know how to navigate these feelings, not that its a new feeling by any stretch. I just do not understand how I can go on from being so pleasantly fine to suicidal and self loathing within in minutes and not be able to step out of it. I have been suffering from poor mental health for over 10 years and I am about to turn 26 next week and I feel so ashamed for how serious my negative thoughts are. Covid was a hard transition especially having moved to a new city a few months before everything started locking down, but now I am here and settled and I have a loving partner, a great connection to their family, a really fun job and I finished my degree. But when I stop and look around I feel like nothing will ever be good enough for me and I will never be good enough, I will always have skin problems and bad teeth and acne. I will never be the artist I used to be (I have a Bachelor in fine art) because I do not have the same drive or passionate that I used to have for it. I will never have the career I built my entire plan around because I am losing my interest in art. I will never have the relationship with my family that I want because I could not stand to stay in my hometown. All I can feel is this tornado of my failures swirling around me all the damn time. It just seems that no matter how many positives come my way they do not last long enough to out weight the negatives. I do not really know what I am looking for I guess I just wanted to say this out loud, or whatever. 0 to 100",Depression
"So I have been with my bf for 5 months , and he already told me he was depressed. To this week nothing particular happened, but i can now feel hes bothered by it. He does not ask me to sleep together, do things and etcI know I am not the problem I am aware of that, I just wanted to ask: how can I be there without suffocating him? I am really clingy, a thing which he usually loves about me but right now I kind of have a feeling that I am doing too much.Any suggestion will be gladly accepted, be frank and tell me how I can not make it worse: its that that bothers me. My bf (21) is having a bad time due to his depression",Depression
"I am so exhausted of this. Just when I think I can finally rest, just when I think maybe things are starting to settle, another hurdle comes flying at me. This month alone we found out my mum could be dying, my girlfriend left me, my parents revealed that they wanted a divorce, my grandad was hospitalised again and just now my little sister's been rushed to A&amp;E with possible brain damage. If there is a god up there they must fucking hate me. it is like life is trying to get me to kill myself and honestly I think I would be better off dead. I attempted when I was 12 but I was stupid and there was no way I could cut deep enough. Now I am 15 and everything is so much worse than it ever has been and I just cannot hold on much longer -- it is going to take a miracle to get me through this. I feel so alone. I feel like the world hates me and I have no idea what I did wrong to deserve this. I thought I was getting better. I was doing so well and now everything's just come crashing down again. I was thinking about carbon monoxide poisoning but I highly doubt there is any way for me to get that. it is looking like I will overdose but that is unreliable as fuck and surviving sounds like hell so idk. Just got to stick around long enough to make sure my sister's alright. I have already contacted one of my ex's friends to make sure they are looked after when I am gone. I do not think there is long left for me. Sorry. I have posted on this subreddit too many times in the span of a week and that is probably really annoying I just have absolutely no idea what to do anymore. I feel sick. If my sister dies then I really cannot do this anymore. It all hurts. Life is really fucking trying me",Suicidal

I am just fucking ugly and all I want is to find a person to love..I feel disgusted by myself that I am jealous of my friends and I just want to end it all but I just see my family's faces and I do not want to put them through this..

"Since I began seeing a therapist 5 months ago I have realised the thought of being happy genuinely terrifies me, and I do not even really know why. I think its probably caused by multiple things. If I had to guess, I think I just do not feel like I deserve to be happy. I have hated myself for so long that maybe I have found comfort in my misery, like its my punishment or something. And in a related way, I think I am scared of my happiness being selfish. Having been miserable for so long, I think Id feel like a selfish asshole if I suddenly got over my issues and starting liking life when I know there is countless people in the world still feeling how I did. And furthermore, its only in the last while have I really begun to take my problems seriously and have been trying to be more sympathetic to myself, but even now with all the shit I am going through its like I can still barely take care of myself. And its like I am afraid of losing the various anxiety issues and what not that make me miserable, because if I lose only them and not my self-hating mindset, Ill have even less reason to sympathise with myself. Ill be some privileged selfish asshole and be even harder on myself than I have ever been.Lastly, I think I am just afraid of the thought of living in general. Death just seems soo simple and peaceful, and I think I have become fixated on the idea of dying. Having been miserable for so many years I think the idea of any more life terrifies me. because even if I did make an amazing recovery, Ill still get new problems, which could be just as bad or worse, and I could also relapse and redevelop all my anxiety and insecurity issues. In fact I have before, in 2018 I made huge strides and then in 2019 it all turned to shit again. And a lot of it was because I had one panic attack in front of an entire class in school, in front of most of the new friends Id made in 2018 who did not know I was an insecure, anxiety ridden loser with no friends before I met them. It pretty much shattered any progress I had made, and thereafter I had multiple panic attacks in school, making it even worse.Those are my interpretations anyway. Whenever I feel like I am making any progress on myself it sends waves of panic through me. I hate it so much, and I wish to fuck I knew what was causing it, because these are all good guesses but I still do not know if that is all there is to it. I am genuinely terrified of being happy and I do not even really know why",Depression
"Did your depression start after a time of serious stress/anxiety? If so, this may be why you feel so disconnected. After times of intense stress, where we do not give ourselves any leeway or breaks, our body naturally will downregulate hormones to essentially force us to stop what were doing. So we may have super high levels of glutamate and norepinepherine keeping us in a stress response, but low levels of dopamine keeping us in a depression, and the high amount of anxiety neurotransmitters because us to feel both depressed and depersonalized (freeze response) If you feel disconnected from reality this may be why",Depression
I am on zoloft and focalin and it is changed my life over the past four years for the better. But this week I have been feeling like I am regressing a lot.

My fiancee went out of town on Tuesday as well which just made things worse. I feel useless and tired and just like shit in general. I think it is hitting extra hard because I have been doing so well for so long. I would talk to my fiancee but she is been through so much with me that I cannot bear to put this on her. I am just lost... what am I doing wrong? I just want to get back in my routine but idk shit sucks. it is getting worse again...,Suicidal
"I am going to make this short because i hate thinking about it, but long story short, I am getting better after months of medication, therapy, etc. My anxiety is at an all-time low and my antidepressants """"do not allow"""" my mind to wander too much into suicidal thoughts. But i hate it, i hate that I am getting better, i feel embarrassed whenever i catch myself doing something not depressing, like taking a walk, laughing, or doing stuff by my own will. And i feel SO SO selfish, i was given immense support from everyone, my mum has spent so so much time and money on therapists, psychiatrists, pills, etc; she is suffered more than anyone else, even more than me since i seem to enjoy being depressed. she is the happiest she is been in months since she can tell I am in a better mood and she is the only reason i have not ""tried harder"" to get worse, but i do not know how long i can keep it going.Something in me just wants me to maybe stop taking my meds without letting her know, get a new self destructive habit, and go back to the old me that did not leave his bed in days and could not keep a conversation for more than 2 minutes, i really miss it.I am going back to school in a couple of months (i dropped out), i started driving lessons yesterday, I am eating better, sleeping better, I am starting to live and behave like a regular person but i cannot handle it, it makes me feel bad, gross, EMBARRASSED, very embarrassed, and its just a cycle of:I am ok this makes me depressed I am ok again this makes me depressed etc.I do not know what to do, I am not even sure why i am even writing this since I will probably end up ignoring whatever help or advice i get, but i guess i needed to vent, thanks for reading and as always sorry for my english how can i be happy about getting better??",Depression

"Everyone in my schooling system thinks I am autistic but I really faked it so my school work would be easier, I stopped going to school because I do not fit in there with anyone and nobody likes how different I am, I have problems about my body I have a dent on my chest and it makes me so self conscious I cannot do anything that requires me to not wear a shirt or people laugh at me and call me an alien, I have a gf but as of recently she is been loosing connection to me since she has her bestfriend back she does not want to be my bestfriend anymore, I have some friends they are really nice but I do not think they understand me, I think that my Dad hates me because I am not the son that he wanted, I feel like a disappointment to him and my family name because I am ""autistic"" and I have not gone to school for 3 years and I feel weak because I was molested and used when I was 10. I am 17 years old. I do not have a job and I used to be a drug dealer 1 year ago just because I hated going to school, when I was dealing I was addicted to MDMA and Xanax, they have both helped heavily with destroying my views and how I see myself, I have lost all of my happy emotions the only feelings that I feel is sadness and hatred to who I am. I cry almost every day of every hour just because living in my body hurts my soul so much. I do not belong on this planet or in this body.

"I have been talking to someone who I really liked. They were a great person and we really clicked. I told her that I could not do this with her because I am dealing with so much shit in my head that it is not fair to her. She said she wanted to be there for me and I shut her down. I am scared to be depressed around other people now. My poor mental health ruined one relationship and I do not want it to ruin another. I know I am much better now than I was in my previous relationship but I am scared that I might be a horrible person again.I am scared to let anyone be close. I feel like I am just getting by daily and cannot make any real connections anymore. The ability to get close to people is non-existent because I am scared that when they see the real me, they will leave. I am trying to improve but what if I cannot, what if I fall apart again? What if I am the piece of shit suicidal asshole that I was before? I am scared to put anyone through that. I kept making up excuses for why this was not going to work out. Distance, what we wanted, culture, but truthfully I am just fucking scared to be close to someone again. I am scared to be vulnerable. I wish I knew how to not be depressed. It controls my life.

"I have so many stressors in my life, all major things that tear me down. Every day I fight a battle not just with my mental health but with the world. Last night I finally broke. After 33 years of a shit show of a life, I am done. What ultimately triggered this is that my son (7m) with ADHD has been expelled from holiday club. I quit my job Jan 2020 because he was not coping in school and managed to find him a specialist educational provider as well as get him on medication. He did brilliantly! I however, hated being a SAHM and a carer. The loneliness is overwhelming and the fact that I only live to provide food and a clean house to 3 children. So, I started to think about going back to work in my area of specialty which is law. I got a job with a police department. Something for me and something where I will meet other adults without being attached to my children. I got all 3 of my children into a childcare provider and settled them in over months. I have officially been working for less than 2 weeks and my son has regressed back to his bad behaviour. He has been kicked out and now I have to quit my job and go back to being his full time carer. I cannot do this for the next 11 years of his life and possibly beyond that. I do not want to live anymore and there is no help out there for my situation. I can go back on antidepressants, I can go to therapy but none of these things fix my problem that I no longer have any autonomy over my life. I am not a person any more, I am merely a mum with no identity other than that of my children. I find no pleasure in anything and exhaust myself pretending to be happy for the sake of my family. I cannot work, and now as it turns out I cannot even die. I cannot leave behind my children, I am their only parent. I have no control in this life over anything. I now think I am too far gone to ever feel happy again. I want to die. I cannot go back to Groundhog Day",Suicidal

"Not because of death, but because she wanted to get away.I have been depressed for over 10 years and maybe this is the lowest point I have ever been to.The last few days it seems like there is been an invisible force squeezing my chest all the time. I can barely eat. I spent 48 hours with only 1 sandwich in my stomach and after that I have forced myself to eat just to be able to get drunk after I get home from work just so the time goes by quickly and I do not feel this damn pain.She was my last friend. I am completely alone now.Losing people is always a disgrace to me, but ok. I have known this friend for 6 years, and even though we had a few periods without talking, we were doing well for almost 2 years, we never even had a fight until last week.Turns out I was pretty drunk and I ended up insisting on telling her that she did not really care about me and how I was a nobody to her. I really insisted on it, because I was drunk and could not even think straight, although she said clearly that she did care.Turns out she was hurt and does not want to talk to me anymore.She was the only person who really mattered and it made me want to keep living, I did not want to bring her pain.I tried to apologize, tried to ask him to understand and forgive me, but to no avail.The worst thing is that I did not even want to attack her the way I did, it is very easy for me to think that someone does not like me, after all I myself think I am rubbish and in no way worthy of any love.I did not even sleep the night that happened. I spent the whole night thinking about how I could kill myself.what is the fucking point on living if my life is a piece of thrash, and I feel bad absolutely all the time?

I am not sure if this depression, and I have not wanted to face it or label myself as such and be forced to deal with the reality of it if it is. I think I am having a hard time differentiating being depressed due to an internal chemical imbalance that needs to be reconciled, or just having a natural reaction to the state of the world or events (previous abuse, climate change, corruption, realizing you likely will not grow up to be what you thought you would be, the passage of time and loss of loved ones etc), or if that is a distinction that even matters?

"Yes. It is necessary. However it is not a cure and does not fix everything. It does not fix trauma or trust issues when they are deeply ingrained because nearly everyone in your life abused and betrayed you. It does not fix depression. Coping mechanisms only go so far. You go to therapy, you talk about it, they give you coping mechanisms that trauma, depression and anxiety supersedes. And you have to trick yourself into having a positive mindset to the point where it is toxic or invalidating or bypassing very real issues sometimes. I hate it. If you do not have love, support or an environment that is not triggering then sometimes therapy is not enough. A recent K-pop star attempted suicide and all I see in the comments are: Get therapy. She needs professional help. The presence of a therapist is only temporary. Even if they are a good one. What about being home alone with your thoughts, trust issues and depression? What about feeling like you need to be held all the time? there is no medium for that. For Christ's sakes. I am so sick of people telling people to get therapy.",Suicidal

"// general narcissist venting, feel free to comment if you wantThe thought of dying without being able to see if anyone cares or not just fucks with me too much to actually commit suicide. I mean of course they would care. People even care when strangers die. The initial shock of someone you knew dying and knowing that you could not do anything about it is very traumatizing. But I think what would affect them is the idea of a family member dying, and not that they would miss things about me or reminisce over memories or anything like that. The only memories they have of me is me being a dumbass or saying ""what?"" five times in a row because my hearing is going.But the thought of this makes me want to go out and be something that I know I cannot be. I want to make something of myself but I just, I cannot. I have nothing to put on my resume, I cannot do taxes, there is so many obvious things that other people know that I just do not! And nobody thinks to tell me because I should already know! Why do not I already know basic crap! Why did I spend my childhood locked in my room instead of trying to learn and develope like a normal child! Why cannot I take care of myself without burning out? If I brush my teeth, shower, get dressed, and do my hair routine all in the same day then I am burnt out! that is it! I cannot do anything else for the day, I am too tired! there is no way I could work or get a job like this! I would burn out after one task and get fired! I hate that my huge sense of self importance has manifested into me always focusing on how I am the worst instead of atleast making me delusional enough to think that I am the best. I hate that my self esteem is based on other people's approval, but unlike other narcs I do not get approval because I am literally shit at everything so I am just an unmotivated sack of shit who cannot do anything. I hate that I even told anyone that I am a narc. Of course they would not accept me!! What the hell was I thinking!! What kind of idiot would expect anything different!! Things are not going to get better for the NPD community, not in my life time atleast! Well, maybe that will be another reason to stay alive. Imagine being an old man and seeing 20 something year olds openly talk about their NPD recovery process that they felt no shame entering because there is no more stigma, experiencing something I could not. Maybe. When I am in my 80s. And my mom, my poor mom. She has to pay for everything because I cannot do shit on my own. Physical therapy, regular therapy, medication, my food, I hate this!! You should not have to take care of me!! You should be relaxing somewhere without worrying about my next diagnosis or my next medication or whether or not any treatment is working!! You should be doing your hobbies and I should be the one buying you things!! Maybe I will get to the point of recovery where I am not so self-centered, and then I can finally let go.

"Yeah, this is a question I have been chewing on for a long time. I have been in the depths before, as I know you all have, too, but even in those deepest depressive periods, I still wonder how I know for certain that what I am experiencing is depression. It being of the subjective mind, it seems like depression does not have strict dimensions or even definitions. it is hard to pin down and say for sure, one way or another, ""I am depressed."" This has been an obstacle for me. Trying to take it seriously. I doubt that what I have is depression. I doubt my own ability to objectively judge this. I doubt my problems are problems at all and this just makes me feel selfish and kind of like a loser that has to fake a mood disorder to get along in the world. The ambiguous nature of depression, other mood disorders, and the feeling mind alone is enough reasonable doubt to because even more suffering in me, like depression that is accompanied by a feeling of guilt and self-deprecation.Is this normal? Part of depression's deception? Or are there ways to draw a line near-ish the middle between depressed and not depressed? We can do it to a very fine degree with physiological illnesses. Surely we could do the same for the mind, but are we there yet? How do you know for certain that depression is ""depression""? I invite you to share your information and opinions.",Depression

They say every cloud has a silver lining but none of these clouds seem to be anything but black, darkness, harsh. &amp;#x200B;Until you realize that you do not have to be here and your sight zooms out, slowly revealing my eyes and the pain they hide as you travel back behind your own eyes and see this figure in front of you, torn by war and so much pain.

"I have been reaching out for help. I do EVERYTHING that I am told to help me feel better.Well today I called a place about the sexual abuse I went through as a kid. A charity that gives therapy to people who have gone through that.Well. Because I was not raped, it is not deemed bad enough. I was simply molested for 2 years by a neighbor as a kid so they do not think I can get help from them.I was referred to this place by a NHS mental health team who keep referring to these places. One place will tell me I am too severe to help. And now, this place says what happened was not bad enough. I was not even abused the right way. Even my abuse was done wrong.Which is the SECOND time I have heard it this week, about TWO different types of abuse. And then people have the cheek to ask me why I am so miserable. I am literally asking for help and doing all the rubbish I am told to do, and yet here we are.Damn. Just damn.(please no ""it gets better"". That makes me feel worse EVERY TIME) I was just told my abuse was not severe enough",Depression

I just got pussy why am I so fckin empty? I am so fckin down. And now I feel like I have used someone and they do not deserve that. I miss my girl so fckin much.

What do I do with this energy. I cannot get her back and I am left with this feeling that clearly I cannot put into someone else and be happy with it.

"Content warning: Please do not read this post if you are suicidal/prone to suicidal thoughts. I do not want to trigger a negative spiral for anyone else.I am 19M from Turkey. My family history from the maternal side is filled with mental health issues, I have a depressed mother and a suicidal sister who is older than me. I have a very sensitive temperament, am very neurotic and introverted. I am somewhat bright academically (not a genius, but significantly above average), have no hobbies or social life. Ever since the age of 13, I have been severely depressed and isolatedI know maany people have it much harder than me, and I am somewhat in a privileged demographic but I really need to vent without holding back. Living in Turkey is very hard nowadays with the islamo and nationalistic fascist regime, and even if I want to migrate, I will be met with some degree of prejudice because I am a middle easterner. I do not want to leave my country ideally too, but there is no choice other than to strive for an escape. I am not religious, believe life is meaningless. Those are not the reasons behind my depression, though. I do not give a shit about life being meaningless, because I know the brain only seeks happiness and meaning is irrelevant in this case. The problem is, I cannot fulfill my needs and it is destroying meMy lack of social life especially hurts in my relationships with girls. I have gone through many rejections, only to deduce thata) my need for approval is making me unattractiveb) I am not good/attractive/sociable enough for women to take notice of me, want meOf course nobody tells those to my face, they are rather the constant messages I come across reading dating advice blogs, psychological studies on attraction etc. It is even more depressing when dating, intimacy and relationships are portrayed through a lens of competition. And even more depressing that I have no satisfying counter arguments against that. I, too, can see that this is all just a competition; but some of us (me included) are not comfortable admitting. I remember listening to the talks of evolutionary psychologists, how they talk about ""everyone is trying to get the best deal they can"" and ""you may be miserable as an 8, since you lust after 10s but 6s lust after you."" Dating is a market; and I just cannot see how you can be happy or fulfilled unless you are in the 1% as a maleI know suicide, if done right, would be the same as falling asleep, just not to wake up. I know painless ways, and losing hope in ever attaining a fulfilling intimacy just makes me lose interest in living. I have a very painful daily lived experience, and I just wish for the pain to go away but it persists. There is always an unfulfilled need for love, and it is veery hard to fulfill that need. And I do not have the skillset to have it fulfilled (and mind you; I have been trying very hard to be social. My temperament is just too apparent)I am going to wait for my therapy sessions. I just want this painful feeling of isolation and rejection to go away. And it will not. I may decide on killing myself a year later if I feel the same way, and things did not change I am considering suicide",Suicidal
"19 years old, male, from the Philippines. The lockdown here has been going on for 2 years and more now. It completely sucks here. Not only the government, but also the parenting style and community. My parents are giant narcissist, gaslighting bastards, apathetic, scapegoating, victim blaming, and abusive people. I grew up as a kid being parentified by my mom, while experiencing how my dad openly cheated on my mom while wasting the money we have. I did not feel like I grew with a father because he never tried to form an emotional connection with me. When he does, it will be him giving something while saying he worked his ass of for it so we should be grateful for it. He has forever glorified himself having a job, and he will use it in any arguments we had; ""I am the one who has the job, who feeds you, and who gives you everything. Be fucking grateful!"" in his words. I would be beaten up by him with a belt as a kid so it has left me traumatized by flinching at anything that is loud, surprising, or both. He has not changed from my childhood until now, except it has only gotten worse as time goes on. He has endlessly made me hate him with no possible resolutions. Calling me a failure, useless, good-for-nothing, and disgrace of a son does not help at all. He is the reason why I despise cheating, abusive, and manipulative people with a passion. His god complex shows to everyone else. It does not help that he is a cop so his temper is extremely bad. He has a fragile ego that will automatically collapse when told he is wrong or disagreed with. He also thinks he is doing our pets a favour by caging and leashing them their entire lives. he is truly an abusive piece of shit that does not deserve a family of his own. he is a manchild that accidentally had children.As for my mother, she is the epitome of gaslighting, victim blaming, and narcissism. You literally cannot talk to her without her taking it personally. Like my horrible father, she also thinks the world revolves around her. This is the person who made me go through parentification as a fucking 6 year old. Until now, I have been her downpour of traumas, pain, bad memories, and rants. I am literally exhausted from everything because of this. And I HAVE to listen to her or else everything turns bad; she manipulates my father to teach me a lesson. She also believes she cannot be wrong. She strongly believes feng shui, the supernatural, superstition, and the occult. She has made our entire lives revolve around superstition. I have been gaslighted by her for who knows how much; I do not even know if my feelings are valid anymore. She would try to have an emotional connection with me, but she would just make it about herself after. Literally goes and minimizes my experiences just because she thinks she had it worse. If I have not said it before, these two are very religious. They would rather pray and complain instead of doing something. They are fanatics of the horrible president we have, and they think everyone should respect them.As their child, I am riddled with face and body acne with no help at all to relieve it; father had extreme face acne, mom has extreme body acne but no help from them. Instead, I am called out for being careless about my body and face by both of them for years. They also told me that it will just go away anyway ""like theirs"", so no medicine is needed. Due to it, I experienced a lot of bullying in my highschool years because of my acne. I could not form proper connections with others and often dressed weirdly to hide my body. I was called the ""Pimple King"" by my classmates; I wanted to kill myself so much from it because I had NO ONE to talk to about it.Fast forward to now, I have fought and kind of got some freedom, but here I am again wanting to fucking die. I had already wanted to die from my highschool daysabout 6 yearscontinuously. I had attempts but none worked. I am doing everything in the house, yet I am called a fucking failure yet again by my piece of shit father for something I did not do; our cat accidentally unplugged the doorbell ringer, which my father uses to call us when he needs us for something, in our room. When he realized there was not any doorbell noises, he checked it out and saw it was unplugged. He called me a failure for it because ""I do not care about anything and do not have a sense for anything"". These days, I cannot find anything enjoyable, interesting, or fun anymore. I just want to die. I am trying to find something to do, but my brain just rings out ""what is the point?"" and I stop. I am just in bed right now wanting to fucking die. Someone take my life please. Please. [LONG POST] Someone kill me please",Depression

I was managing an exercise routine, cooking lots of healthy and fun meals instead if junk food, spending more quality time with my family, enjoying hobbies again, thriving in school, and managing a self care and hygiene routine (which was always one of my big struggles).I felt like I finally got things under control but I made a big mistake that is sent everything crashing down. I took on extra responsibility and I put too much on my plate. I would rather not elaborate on what it was, but now I feel like I have no time for myself so all of my routine went out the window. I had to do a late withdraw from my last 2 college courses when I had maintained a 3.9 prior. I do not shower or brush my teeth for days at a time, I find myself binge eating and falling back into restrictive eating disorder habits, I only really look forward to eating and getting in bed every night.

"Quick background; I suffered social anxiety for most of my 20's and went in and out of depression throughout the years. I am now 31 with no friends, just a boyfriend and all my family who I barely get along with anyway live in another state. Over the last few years I have learnt to be ok with feeling lonely and being by myself. I have learnt to enjoy my own company and that is great and all but I am still friendless. I also went through a horrible year in 2019 where I went numb to something that was happening in my relationship so I would not ""feel"" so much kind of like depersonalization/derealization. Things have gotten better but the numbness has remained. I am not sure how to explain it properly but I do not have anything in my life that is thrilling or exciting to me nor do I care to seek this out. Most people have a vice like shopping, gambling, some sort of sport or activity that gives them a rush. I used to want to travel, I thought maybe that could fill my time or get me excited but even though I have the money and could travel (once out of lockdown), I just do not care for it anymore. it is like, I cannot take the memories when I die so what is the point? I could sit in my lounge room and street view places in Canada for example so once again, what is the point?All I do these days is work, come home, click around on some sites and do it all again the next day. I barely talk to anyone online. My relationship is boring and stale and even though we could spice it up, sometimes I just do not care to. I love my boyfriend but I want someone else to talk to and hang out with. I almost have no reaction to things. If I won a million dollars or even 5, I think my reaction honestly would be ""meh"". Everyone my age is either having kids, married or have successful careers. I have never chased success so I really do not care to climb the career ladder or chase money. None of that matters to me. I am not sure what does. I cannot help but feel as if I am wasting my life away. Sometimes I wish I could have a crazy life. Sometimes I get the urge to do something so out of character to shock myself. To get that thrill. To feel excitement.God, I am so utterly bored with my life. I feel numb about most things.

"tw talk about eating disorder further downHi, sorry for long post and bad formatting. I do not know who to ask this as I am on a long waiting list for a psychologist and have no one else to talk to.I have always had problems with breakfast, mostly because I have trouble waking up and am so tired that the thought of food makes me nauseous. Before work (I am currently on sick leave) I used to force down a sandwich only because I know I faint easily. Work also helped me maintain a somewhat proper meal schedule as I had designated lunch and snack breaks, and I always had an appetite right after work.Now when I have been been home several months, eating is a massive problem. Getting up earlier than 2pm is a huge but rare success but even if I do I just do not feel like eating for hours, despite feeling so hungry my stomach hurts and my head spins. I just do not crave anything and I try to drown the hunger with water and cigarettes and occasionally save myself from fainting by eating dextrose.This results in me lying around like a zombie for hours, not having the energy to do anything, until I feel too weak to make even a sandwich without having to sit down. Basically, during daytime, I HATE eating. I wish humans did not HAVE to eat and could survive off water.But then in the evening, I often find the cravings wash over me. Not only do I tend to eat unhealthy to begin with bc I do not have the energy to cook (for example I often just have microwave food or frozen pizza), but at night while watching shows or playing games I feel some kind of NEED to have something. Sometimes cigarettes and tea works, but often the cravings are too strong. It can be anything I have lying around, like crisps, chocolate, nuts, anything. Sometimes it feels like a proper craving but sometimes it feels like I just have to occupy my hands and mouth. Not giving into this often results in nail biting instead, or even worse pulling at my toenails until they bleed (gross i know, but I physically cannot stop and have not been able to show my feet to anyone throughout my life). Giving into the cravings on the other hand makes me feel disgusting, like a grotesque emotional meat machine that keeps eating just for the sake of eating. I feel disgusted by the warm feeling I got after eating those tasty donuts, like how I sometimes feel disgusted after spending money on some useless expensive shit I do not really need but that gave me happiness for one small moment. It makes me feel materialistic but like, with food, if that makes any sense.Now I know the lack of food during the day probably is a big reason for the nocturnal cravings. But it is so hard forcing myself to eat when my appetite is not there, let alone cook proper meals. I am also very conscious about my body and feel like shit knowing that I have put on some weight in recent years, even though I KNOW deep inside that no one cares about that and that weight should not define my attractiveness. But despite this, I have never had an ED. And despite having somewhat ED-like thoughts about food, this feels like mainly a problem with appetite related to my depression and apathetic tendencies. I know that if I could just pull myself together, I could have somewhat healthy eating habits.My past therapist kept nagging me about meal planning but even when I am grocery shopping I cannot for the love of god come up with any ingredients to buy, despite being kind of good at cooking. Hell, planning ANYTHING nowadays feels like climbing a mountain.Does anyone have similar problems, like lack of appetite? How do you refrain from giving into cravings/comfort eating? How do you manage your daily food intake when depression takes away most energy and enthusiasm to do anything at all? How do you deal with apathy, the kind that makes it hard to even walk from the couch to the bed? How do you keep afloat? Because I am on the verge of drowning. No appetite during day, cravings at night",Depression

"I have posted about it several times, but here goes. 12 months ago I joined a dating website and met a Thai woman. We got on EXTREMELY well. I thought she was the one for me. It later transpired that she had 2 children which she did not tell me about. Odd, but ok. I decided to go with the flow and see whether we could make it work. Shortly after, we got into a relationship.One night I video-called her and she did not reply. She said she was feeling unwell and she would see me tomorrow. When I turned up the next day, she was standoff-ish. I saw her phone on the side so I grabbed it and took a look at her photo album, looking for the photos we would taken a week earlier.I was horrified to see a picture of her in bed with another man. she would cheated on me the night I called her. Even worse, after I confronted her, she told me it was for money. Yes, he would paid my girlfriend to sleep with him. Turns out she was on some kind of dating app and had arranged that behind my back. There were a few other guys she would arranged to see but she did not in the end.She assured me it would not happen again and she had not done it before. Turns out it was all a big fat lie. I found out she was a hooker. By this point we would already given it another go. I would got attached to her and her two. children. I would cooked for them, bought them things - I felt like a part of their family.Anyway, I thought it was all going well and that was behind us, when she cheated. Again. I saw a guy online reviewing her. Yes, REVIEWING her service(s) and he described what happened and how much she charged. I was devastated. I cried buckets of tears.Fast forward a few months and we had given it another go and we were getting along well - when all of a sudden she dumped me. She said she was going back to that lifestyle and it left me a broken man. I would loved her, forgiven her several times, I would been looking after her children. I did absolutely everything I could for them. I am just left with pain. I will not commit suicide, but the pain has been so bad I have thought things like: ""when I am gone I will not be in this pain"".she is blocked me on everything.

"I am so damn exhausted of my mind screwing everything up. I am about to turn 30 in a few weeks and although I have been fortunate enough to have had many women interested in me throughout the years, I just cannot seem to hold a stable relationship for longer than a few months. When I was younger it was not a huge deal, but now that I am getting older I am beginning to feel I may never be able to develop a long-lasting meaningful romantic connection with anyone and it makes me feel so deeply alone.The thing is, I am able to clearly see how it is me pushing my partners away. Once the initial excitement wears off, I go back to being aloof, insecure and self-centered and I can sense my masculine essence eroding. I can see how my partners go from being attracted to me to feeling sorry and completely turned off. I do not blame them. I do not want them to carry any of my burdens. I want to own up to them and keep fighting to get better. But with each passing relationship, I just become more afraid of opening up about my mental struggles and having them realize that the confident, fun version of me is kind of a part-time deal.On top of it all, I seem to be developing some kind of body dysmorphia. Depression sure seems to have done a number on me physically and its causing me to age a lot more quickly than my peers. I am rapidly losing my hair, about a third of my beard and body hair is already gray, I have bad eye bags and dark circles and, although I have tried, I just do not look good completely bald and I have been told as much by friends. I legitimately hate looking in the mirror most days. I even started dating older women in hopes that it would even things out, but the same thing happened.My last partner recently left me after I became insecure and started acting weird and it really hurt me because I actually did care about her. But somehow, just a week later, the universe has already put two new women in my life who are showing interest. The thing is, I am seriously afraid of trying this again and screwing it up once more. I do not think my heart can take much more disappointment and I am tired of superficial connections.I know I need to develop self-love and find something to get excited about every time I wake up before I try to find someone again, but the thing is I am also very lost and lack direction in life. The only thing I am truly passionate about is music, and that is just not going to pay the bills or provide me with the financial stability that a relationship requires. Besides that, I am working on finishing a degree in biochemistry (two semesters left), but I have no desire to go to grad school or Med school, and the job prospects with a B.S. in that field look bleak.Are there any guys out there who have managed to be in successful or satisfying relationships in spite of all your struggles? If so, how did you manage? I do not think my depression will ever go away at this point, and I do not want to end up alone or hurting myself and others even further. Thank you for reading.

"I have been in therapy and I feel so much better. it is been a year since the last time I thought about ending my life, I have done so much work and I still have to, but I feel really proud of myself. It gets better, I promise!! I no longer want to kill myself",Suicidal
i do not know why i even had hope that it would get better. Things only get worse and i hate when ppl say it will get better. My mind is telling me to give up everyday I am trying to fight but i do not think i was made for this world. I love my parents and they are very caring but i do not think that is enough reason for me to keep going. I have nothing going for me and i hate myself. I remember when i was a kid and was actually happy with myself but those days are long gone. Now all i can think about is how worthless i am and how i do not belong. I think this might be my last few days here. I hope everyone has a good day and keeps fighting. it does not get better,Suicidal

"I needed to get this out because I have been bottling up everything for 3 years now.I have felt horrible for the last 3 years now. I am diagnosed with severe social anxiety, Anger issues, ADHD and, autism.3 years ago I got sexually abused for 2 months. I have not ever told anyone about this and still think about it every day.The next year while on vacation I was mad and out of rage I hit a window. This cut into my artery and I almost bled out. I still get flashbacks from this and never fully recovered.Due to covid I failed all my classes because I did not have any motivation and was severely depressed. I just want for it to all be over.It feels like nothing in my life is going well. Every time I am happy because I am with friends I zone out and think about all of the things stated above. I just cannot deal with this anymoresidenote: I am sorry if this is hard to read. English is not my first language and I am very bad at talking about how I feel .",Depression

"First time posting here and feeling a bit ambivalent about doing so as I have never really been active in this community or helped anyone, so feel a bit self indulgent and selfish posting. 30, soon to be 31. I have had an issue with weed since I was 19 (did not accept I had an addiction until 24 but never made any efforts to address it due to my own self loathing and warped mindframe that I ""deserved"" to be nothing more than an addict and waste of space). Cut down hugely but now that my mind is clearer, I cannot stop thinking about how incredibly shit a person I am. Used to have friends in Uni, drifted from a lot of them due to smoking (I would flake on invites to things and smoke myself into a daze. Rinse and repeat). Got together with someone from a local sporting community I was involved in and had tons of friends in it. I let myself believe that these people actually liked me and that my self-loathing was unwarranted. When we broke up, and I very shortly thereafter suffered a catastrophic leg injury (I can walk again now, thankfully), it became very clear a lot of those people much rathered my ex than myself and I lost what I thought were very close friends. No one bar my family visited me in hospital and none of those friends ever reached out to see how I was. It destroyed me for a while but I talked myself into believing I was better off without people like that. It still stung and I basically have never properly returned to social media or to that community due to feeling so shit and hated (it was very clear that some of them really really did not like me, and a lot of rumours were spread by a dick I had rejected from that community after he had propositioned me. I was not around to defend myself due to the injury and I guess people decided they would rather believe his lies than ask me. A further indication of how low they view me.)That was a good few years ago and I still cannot shake the sense of ""betrayal"" and that I am clearly a POS if all of these people decided they wanted nothing to do with me. Out of sight, out of mind.I feel like anyone who is not family that is still in contact with me is doing it as a favour to me, and cannot shake the feeling everyone actually really dislikes me. I hate myself and find social interaction difficult with people because in the back of my mind I am always telling myself that the person hates me or finds me boring/self indulgent/an asshole etc. This has further made me withdraw as I do not want to inconvenience others. I have a good job I feel I do not deserve, which I am struggling with doing at the moment due to how low I am. I do not see the point in anything and find myself thinking that if I killed myself at least work could hire someone competent. I have a loving boyfriend who is incredible and so patient but due to historic sexual abuse, I can be quite nervous with intimacy. I have only ever once really been able to be in the ""here and now"" in the moment with him without my mind dissociating or me recalling the abuse. I have found myself thinking if I killed myself, he could be free to do what he wants and eventually meet someone who is good for him. I have been talking myself out of breaking up with him as I know if I do do that, that is one less obstacle on the path to killing myself. I cannot shake the feeling that I am the worst thing for him and that I am wasting his life when he could be so much happier with someone who deserves him. I have a supportive family. My mum and her partner are great, getting on in life and I find myself getting worried about the 2 of them as they get older and then chastise myself for being kind of ""ageist"". I have a sister, we are not close but we try to be but there is a lot of tension and tbh I do not like her as a person and believe a lot of my self hatred is rooted in some very serious bullying and abuse by her when I was a small kid. I have a brother but he is estranged from the family. We very occasionally check in but it is clear he wishes he was not related to us at times (he has his own mental health issues and I think blames our family for a lot of it.). I have aunts and uncles who are lovely and kind and I love them all very much. But. I feel like if I killed myself it would make everyone is lives so much easier.I can be hard to get on with, and am high strung and have a hearing sensitivity that makes being around loud or shrill noises very difficult. That sadly includes the noises of kids simply having fun and being a bit boisterous. I hate that I get physiological pain just by being around my niece and nephew when they are giddy. I am abnormal and I feel like I bring everyone else down or that they are only nice to me because they feel sorry for me. I cannot stop thinking I am a burden, a waste of space, a nuisance. When I see people I know who are very sick, or people with very serious conditions that impair their quality of life, I feel like an ungrateful POS that I have a working healthy body and yet want to die. I do not deserve my body and keep finding myself wishing there was a way I could trade. I wish that I could give my able body or my natural life expectancy to others. That if I killed myself, the x amount of years I did not live could transfer over to someone else.If I killed myself, my mum and her partner would not have to catch up with me or endure my presence. If I killed myself, my sister would not have to poorly pretend to tolerate me nor pay back a loan I gave her years ago which she keeps dodging. If I killed myself, some of my savings could go to my brother which would hugely help him out. If I killed myself, my extended family would not have to waste any time talking to me at family gatherings and they could actually have some fun. If I killed myself, the majority of my savings would go to my mum and her partner and would help them do some renovations on my mum's house or help her to buy the house of her dreams. If I killed myself, my partner could be free, would not have to mind me, and would also get a whack of my savings which would help him travel the world like he is always dreamed of. If I killed myself, people would not have to be polite to me. If I killed myself, I cease to be a burden (after the funeral has been planned and done). If I killed myself, depending in the means, I could donate my organs and actually do something good with my life for once.I know my mind is clearly twisted right now but I cannot stop thinking that if I honestly just killed myself, everyone else would be so much better off. I am miserable, I constantly try to suppress it or hide it, I feel like people really dislike me or tolerate me and almost all of my friends have drifted away from me. I have no common ground with anyone and my drug addiction wasted so many years where I ultimately have no real hobbies, or interests or personality. I just want to die but know it will hurt my family. Good live from the outside but I just want to press ""off""",Depression
I do not care if anyone reads this or upvotes. I just need to ask why I cannot just be happy? Why cannot I be normal and enjoy things anymore? Why does it have to suck? Why does not anything make it better? Why cannot I be happy for what I know are good things around me and in my life? Why did not I bring my gun today to end this? Why? Sorry. Why?,Depression
"Last year the lack of future hope, and general pointlessness of life finally got to me, the cycle of disaster, recovering from lifes shit, then being thrown another curve ball finally got to me. I made a decision one night, and drunk myself silly and tried to jump off a high rise flat building, but could not get myself over the edge. The police arrested me, got me off the building and took me to a cell. I got let out later that week, I told everyone I was just drunk and it was a mistake... everything they needed to hear to let me go.I decided that day on my way home, to just enjoy one more year of life, ignore any problems as it will not matter in the long run, and hope my life spirals downwards into such a shit hole that the act of actually killing myself will not be as difficult next time around, take the options away from myself.I actually had some good times in this year, met a girl that went well for a good few months(as far as relationships go with people that is a good one for me) tried new hobbies, Got in rather good shape due to taking up boxing, traveled to a few places I wanted to see. it is not been bad, just not sustainable. Today, one year on I am in more dept than I ever have been, I am about to lose my job due to not really being in a fit state to perform at it anymore(and quite frankly, not focusing at all on it because of the plan in the back of my head) I still have 2 friends, but I do not really get on with people full stop. This is what I wanted a year ago, and although I know that, I guess I did not think I would make it this far, and now it is suddenly here. Nothings changed, I still cannot bare the thought of going through life like this any longer. It feels like just living life because that is what is expected. But I still am scared to die.I am well aware that within basically the next 30 days or so everything is going to come crumbling down around me, it is already in motion, I have done a very good job of not leaving myself any outs. And the state I am currently in, I know I will not handle it well enough to see a way to get through any of it. I guess just hoped it would be easier this time to actually pull the trigger as it were, yet it does not feel like it is going to be. I really do not want to carry on with this stuff. But I do have people who love me who will be upset. I do want to die, but I am scared of that moment still. In a way I wish I would just happen to step in the road at get hit by a bus and not have to actually do the act myself.I do not think at this point I will ever be able to do it, but I am unfortunately very good at hurting my life in other ways.I regret not killing myself one year ago. One Year ago today, I found myself locked in a hospital cell for my own protection. Today I have still had enough.",Depression
"Hello RedditI met someone recently on a dating app, and we have been going steady for a week now. We are on different parts of the country and everything has been virtual. I enjoy his company and I think the feeling is mutual. The problem is, there is this growing nagging feeling on the back my head that everything is bound to turn bad. I am already imagining all kinds of break-up scenarios in my head. there is this occasional feeling that he might be growing uninterested as time goes by, and the fact that my brain tends to misinterpret his every word against me is not helping.The feeling is so crippling I do not feel butterflies anymore every time we talk. I feel fear.Will this ever go away? This is my first legitimate date and I would hate to screw this up. He does not know about my depression and I do not plan on telling him so big a skeleton as early as now. How do I possibly deal with this?

"I am sorry if you are already going through something and that if what I wrote, brought you down or something but I needed to let things go somewhere and this is the best place for this. Please bear with me, it will be a little long.So, here it goes. There comes a time in life when things just go down and down. You pick yourself up, hopeful for things to get better, you try and work but the end results stays the same and more things get burdened up after that. Like, it has been too long, I break down, then get back up hoping things will finally get better every single day and when you keep doing all this for a long time, you start to get tired and lose hope, but the damn things inside your heart and mind makes you think something will get better only for you to get disappointed again.I am dealing with my problems, I want to focus on them but when you have problems of not only yours but also of your closed ones it gets really tough, you get lost and do not know what to do, how you got into this mess and how you can get out of it. I have had depression for as long as I can remember but it did not affected me much, nut the last 5-6 years have been too much. Ever since I become an adult, I realised how much problems I am around, that are not only mine but of others close to me as well. These are one of the few years of my life that I want focus only on my career but this is just so tough. The things, problems, responsibilities, situation, future, all this has become so much for me to handle I am scared about everything now, 2 days I will be okay and ambitious but something will arise and I will be back to square one. This has been the case as long as I remember, everytime I work to change my life, some uncontrollable shit happens, that breaks me. I try to stay positive, I try to not break down. Apart from this, I feel alone, I have never shared my problems, my situation, stuff I go through with anyone. Although, its not like I have not tried, I did but the thing is no one wants to listen and I do not blame them for this either, nobody wants to listen to that. They will post hundreds of stuff about to talk to them, that they will listen and what not but the thing is nobody wants to listen, no matter what they say. Sometimes, I want that one person that I can talk, that one person with whom when I talk, I forget about all these problems and just be with her, you know. Like, one thing I have always been sure about is that I will take care of that special person for the rest of my life, but have been hurt in relationship and stuff so much that I am afraid of all this now, no girl wants to be with a guy like me, I have seen my crush literally with a person who is rude to her, blames her, treats her like shit than to be with me and they have been together for a long time. I mean, I do not know what is wrong with me or what I do not know. I genuinely care for others and wants the best for others, and I do not care that other people do not want the same for me. But have been hurt so much, in friendship, relationship, what not because of which I have developed several trust issues before opening up, I am scared to open up because I did that easily in the past and fuck, they left or betrayed me as usual but still I do not want to hurt or want anything bad to happen to them. I was even bullied at school for sometime, not physically, and thought about quitting school and taking my life. Now that I am writing this every bad, every damn thing are coming back, that I did not wanted to remember. I lost friends at school, they stopped talking which I afterwards got to know that was because someone was saying different different made up things on my name. Almost every single one of my friend, that I had near my house shifted from here and I ended up losing contact with them as well. I spent a lot of time all by myself that I did not even managed to hold friends at college or forgot the way of maintaining relationships. I was told that some.girls were interested in me during college and at school but the scars and the problems never gave me the courage to move forward and build one relationship with someone special. Sometimes, I See other couples and see how supportive the girls are to their boyfriends and what not and I want that, I want that connection, that feeling of love again in my life but I am afraid that I will mess it up and also, I do not want someone else to go through what I am going through because I know how tough it is but still my stupid mind and heart wants that certain someone who will love me and I will love her. I do not even know what to do or want anyone. I am losing hope again.Btw thank you, if you read it. I am grateful, this was just a rant. I hope you are doing great and your problems fade away and only happiness comes in your life. And sorry for this long, I needed to let things out otherwise my mind was going insane. Sorry I have to let some things out",Depression

"This morning I had an appointment with my mental health doctor, along with my social worker. For about 15 minutes we went through the usual conversation about asking how things were with medication, sleep etc.I then decided to be upfront about planning to kill myself after my birthday is done with (3rd of August). They were very shocked by this and asked me why. I just told them that I cannot be bothered anymore and I burst into tears. I cannot remember the last time I cried that much, it was a bit of a relief to let it out.But yeah, needless to say they are really worried about me and they want to try to push psychological therapy to come sooner. They also suggested about putting me on a ward to held keep me safe.I just want to curl up in a ball in a corner and be forgotten about. I think saying I do not want to live is the right way of putting it. Rather that I do not want to exist as I feel non existent anyway so that might as well be made a reality.

"I am sad and I am scaredGuys idk where else to turn to with my feelings right now. I am just so frustrated. I have been in my antidepressants for 6 weeks now and I am not doing okay this past week. Idk if its the circumstances of my life right now or if my medication is not working.. what started this all was me kicking my sister out of my house for disrespect and overstepping boundaries, then basically my mom was supposed to go to rehab so I dedicated 2 days to try and help her get ready.. while I was at her house getting her ready some drama happened and My sister (the one I kicked out) was trying to fight my mom, so I just stepped between them and then my dad comes between me and my sister and yells at me like I was the one instigating. He backed me into a corner almost yelling and cussing at me. He never touched me, but he kept walking towards me so ofc I stepped back. And it just brought back bad memories of my childhood but not a specific one if that makes sense anyway I ended up bringing her to the airport the second day. Well something happened at the airport that was neither of our fault and she said she did not want to go anymore so that upset me and I cried the entire way to her house which was an hour. Then my cat has to have his leg amputated and its going to cost us $1000 or more after everything is said and done with his er visit, preop exam, and surgery My sleep schedule has been messed up and it gets worse everyday. I sleep till 4 in the afternoon and I am ashamed of myself. I feel disgusted by myself honestly. I start school august 18 and part of me feels like I cannot make it bc of the way I am dealing with stress rn. I am over whelmed and now I am discouraged and that makes me feel ever worse. I hope someone can understand what I mean. Its almost like I am sad BECAUSE I am sad in a way. I am in therapy but I did not get to make it to my appointment yesterday because of my sleep schedule and also staying home with my cat. I have no friends and I feel like I annoy everyone so that puts me into antisocial mode. I just want it all to stop. I was doing so good the first 4 weeks of my meds and slowly it got worse and I feel I am right where I was before and I am scared that I am ganna have to be depressed forever bc medication is not working .

"I am 31. I was living my perfect life for 7 years. Prior to that I was depressed and felt lost in life. I was engaged to my soulmate, the one person I felt Id spent my life searching for and could not live without. We had a beautiful 4 bed house in need of work which I was working hard on renovating. I was also at university getting a bachelor of science in CGI having realised finally what I wanted to do with my life. I was a whirlwind of happiness and productivity. We were looking forward to when I graduated so we could work more on the house together, get married finally, and start trying for a baby. For the first time in my life I had lasting long-term happiness, it was beautiful. The week I graduated she told me she would fallen out of love with me and there was nothing to be done. I think my absence and stress due to uni had turned me into a burnt out, argumentative, and barely present person over lockdown. She had ownership of the house so I lost that too and had to move back in with my parents. I had so much work still to do to create a showreel and get a job and was kind of looking forward to doing it but now I have lost all passion for my work. Its been 3 months and I still dream about her every night. I lay in bed drifting in and out of consciousness until the afternoon, unable to face another day of rotting away in my parents dark spare room. The amount of daylight I waste in bed means I have to spend more of the worst, loneliest hours of the late night unable to sleep.I do not want to die, I just want my old life back, but that is never going to happen.

Then why am I even trying? I know I cannot hold up this stupid persona you want me to have. I cannot justify just chasing stupid things in my head. I do not care about your money, I do not care about your rules, I just want mine and I want you out of my way. I wish I had the means to retaliate, I really do. Teach people that it is not ok to take, regardless of how powerful you think you are.My therapist says it sounds like a threat. If I had the means, it would not be a threat. It would be inevitable. You force your will on me, steal from me, you pay the price.But as it stands, I have no method to force you to pay. So I just sit and waste away.

"Today's a bad day. And I mean that kind of bad that I thought I would never experience again. it is so fucking hilarious tbh. it is like life saying 'you thought bitch' straight to my face. Anyways it got me thinking. Ever since I can remember (like 3-5yrs old) I felt like I was not supposed to be here, like I am not a human. I do not really feel things - and I mean it. Whether we talk positive or negative feelings I do not think I have ever truly felt them. I feel nothing. I learned how to act by watching others but never really understood why people would feel e.g. sad, happy or excited. So my life turned into a LARP a long time ago. I have realized that me being happy and wanting to live is just a phase. And those phases always come to an end. And then I realize nothings going to change. And I get kind of scared. because I know no matter what tomorrow, in a month, in 10 years - I will always feel empty and disconnected and it will always haunt me. I am like a broke good that needs to be shipped back to the factory.So, I am 26 now, unemployed, a NEET, have no insurance (that is a new one, to spice things up), have no friends, been faking that everything's alright to my family for 5 years, am broke as fuck (about $1500 in debt), am unhealthy and have an existential crisis when I go to sleep and when I wake up.So, like why should not I? because I really cannot think of a good reason rn.

"I have had more downs in my life than ups to be honest but the main core of this situation was and still is because of my parents' we were taught to respect them and love them because they were the ones who raised us and ""put a shelter over ours heads"". For me these last two years were absolute hell and it was not because of the pandemic but there are several reasons like:1. I am pretty smart and got into med university by the age of 17 and because of the amount of stress and trauma I had to deal with I failed2. After failing my parents gave me a second chance to reenter the university and I took it but I was so unhappy that I chose not to do it and went against my parents simply because I was severely depressed and hospitalized due to psychological pains like constant chest pains and I could not breathe3. My parents were not supportive of me. They were supportive when they where showing off to their peers or friends and my dad told me "" You are nothing but a disappointment and you embarrass us wherever we go"" I was highly discouraged4. I still get yelled at and pretty much am verbally insulted and was told I cannot do shit in life because I am a complete failure. I really hated when my dad used to tell me ""You are going to be a doctor so you should know this"". The only thing I know, is that I really really hate you and this hate adds up even more daily.5. I have this new opportunity where I technically can go to another country and go to university there and my parents will not be able to come. I feel so restrained and so closed in like in a box and I suffocate so I feel like I should say fuck you to my parents and leave but I do not know how well I can deal with myself there too6. Technically they killed all my dreams, what I could have became and they took my dreams and crushed it and are the MOST negative people I have ever seen in my life and I do not even want to look at them. I know it is unethical to hate your parents but do not blame the ones they do because some parents clearly suck and I even told them "" You should have never became parents"" or ""I wish I was never born I did not ask to you to be my parents""My parents makes me want to kill myself and have suicidal thoughts and I cannot take it anymore. They do not know how to communicate at all and they have zero empathy and funnily enough my parents hate each other and themselves as well; weird how they have to reflect that on me too. I was an innocent kid with big dreams. I was not born to be insulted like this, they are the fakest people I have ever met too. Acting like they care about me in front of others all the fake hugs and such and ask me why I do not ever let them to hug me; it is because I hate you and I do not want to see you. I do not know what to do anymore...should I leave to another country and do not see them again? It seems pretty huge but I cannot deal with this kind of toxicity anymore..

I am close to my spouse and kids, but that is it. I do not have social media accounts, I do not text people, and now that I am working from home every day I barely interact with anyone from work other than emails and the occasional phone call. For the last 6 months I have very little job motivation and have started to eat unhealthily, putting on some weight. Feeling completely isolated from society, I have started to not care about COVID, what is happening in the world, and so forth. I still enjoy my solo hobbies though, mostly gaming and watching TV. I only leave the house a few times a week for some exercise in the park, or for a swim with my son. I do not particularly feel lonely, and have zero motivation to go out and make friends or join social activities. I never thought I could be depressed, because outside of working hours I am quite contented. I joke around with my family, I enjoy my gaming and so on.

I have to be so careful with what I eat. Otherwise it sets my stomach of. And slowly slowly,my ed started again. Its a sneaky fucking demon. Its like someone whispers in my ear: are you sure you need to eat that,have you seen how much weight you have been loosing,have you noticed that your bones are showing more and more? Keep this up and soon you will be perfect. And with that comes my other friend. Depression. I do not want to get up in the morning,I do not want to see people,they exhaust me,they make me angry and annoyed. I do not want to do anything. And those horrible thoughts of ending myself. I just want to die. If I could just leave this world and sleep forever. The only thing holding me above the surface are my kids. How much I love them. How I could never do that to them. I could never leave them with that pain. Only reason I posted here is because I needed to get it out one way or another. I am not looking for pity or help. Hopefully I will bounce back soon.

I am scared that I will be judged by my peers. of older people who would not even dare to listen and understand. because i know, even if they do not tell me. they will think of me as this weak-ass, ungrateful low-life.it is not normal to talk about mental health from where i am, after all.I have never once tried to self-diagnose myself, as i think i cannot look objectively at my own situation.

I have thought of killing myself thousands of times: of jumping from a five-story building, overdosing on ferrous sulfate pills, hanging myself, suffocating myself. sadly, like many things in my life, i never did succeed in doing any one of them. i never even attempted them. it seems that I am scared of the pain it will cost me, of how it will feel. of the possibility that I will survive to live another day with my family knowing that i tried doing it to myself. of the judgement they will give me.in conclusion, i care too much about what others think. of what they will feel. at the expense of myself. and i guess i will be stuck in this limbo indefinitely until i get better. if that time ever comes. thank you for reading. hey, you! hoping that you are just okay. i am in limbo.",Suicidal

And in a recent post, someone confirmed that they have a new group chat.I have been under the worst depressive period ever, after doing so well in 2019, and because I was not ready to socialize and talk about mundane things with them or joke around with them, I told them I will just be with myself for a while. They were initially understanding, and then as time went on I just noticed the group chat became inactive.These are the same people who made fun of me behind my back all because I privately chided one of them (my closest friend) for being so carelessly ignorant about Covid. For context, vaccination rollout in my country is slow, transmission is highhe is living with a senior who in the past tested positive; and his sister tested positive for Covid twice too (she works in the hospital). So as a concerned friend I would tell him not to go out unless it is essentialand since we have a super close bond I did not really think about me being overbearing; we have been friends for almost 20yrs and this is how we are to each other.Once during a call, he let it slip that on one of his numerous dinners out he, being the jokester that he was, made fun of me with my friends for acting like his mom. And that hurt me because it was a private matter, and now he has painted me as this kill-joy, paranoid person. And that gutted me.it is one of the reasons I started to feel distant from that group, and when they started to be cold after I told them how I would been struggling with my mental health, that settled it.I am sorry for ranting. But I feel absolutely alone. They were my closest circle of friends, top tier. And then I am shunned just because I am no longer fun to be around with.It feels like we are all in high school again when I would feel anxious or depressed, and they would choose to hang out with our other classmates who are louder, extroverted, and down to play whenever.Depression sucks.

"I am someone who has older parents than most people, my Dad is 44 years older than me and my Mum is 40 years older than me, I am in my mid teens.They have had heated arguments years ago, and they used to happen very occasionally. If they were a few years younger they would have got divorced, I am sure of it. There is no doubt in my mind that they do not love each other, or at least not anymore. Over really simple things they just yell at each other constantly, and recently its happened for four days straight, very long arguments.I absolutely hate it. It makes me cry away to my room and shut the door tight and put on headphones so I do not hear a word of what they are saying. I want nothing more than for them to stay together and not spilt up, for the sake of the family. If they divorce I do not know what side to take, but I know them well enough to tell that they will make me choose one.I am well aware that divorced parents is a very common thing. I always thought as a kid that there was no way your parents could ever not like each other, but clearly I was far from right. I recently have felt the urge to step in myself and just tell them both to shut up and get along, and have even considered buying flowers for my Mum and telling her it was my Dad so that they would hopefully calm down or something. It sucks, it really does. I just want them to like each other again. Hearing your parents fights everyday is just the worst.",Depression
"So I am a mess, a shitstorm of you will. I am in my early-mid 40s, single, no kids, trapped where I am, drinking problem, sporadically employed, deeply depressed and a glutton for taking on other people's shit. Not a cuckold (because that would take effort into actually starting/having a relationship) but not some bullshit Alpha, just someone who does not see the fucking point of dragging anyone into my bullshit. Get the picture? I have had about 14 beers (are still going) writing this, probably the only reason for my honesty.I am living back in my father's house (explains the dryspell) having failed as a trucker and (most recently and twice over) an Amazon employee, my manager at Amazon killed my transfer to the trucking dept without a word to me and while I was ""SUPPOSED* to be covered by their ""blue vest"" rookie rules (which are bullshit as are their ""sign on bonuses"") and the job that I left for (JB Hunt) died on the vine too. there is a woman who I ""was"" involved with years ago that I still have STRONG feelings for, but I have no idea how to voice any of it. Would probably be worse if she in any way felt the same.I have been having suicidal thoughts and impulses for longer than I would admit, thinking of more than a few ways of getting it done. Pills, a nose, driving of a bridge, I have put too much thought into it.I am seeing myself as beyond any help at this point, I am mainly wiring any of this just to get it out.Probably too much text for even Reddit at this point, damn sure Twitter or probably facebook.

"I am sobbing while I write this post. I do not think I am in extremely imminent danger so I am probably not a super high priority, but if even one person could help that would mean the world to me. I never thought I would have to post on a subreddit like this. But I have had suicidal thoughts on and off for years, and it keeps threatening to culminate. Tonight has been one of the worst nights. I will try and keep my reasons quick, as I do not know if I even deserve to complain. I was born into a fairly okay situation, middle class, mostly okay family, things like that, so why am I sad? Well, I have lots of mental health issues that at least noticeably impact my ""normal"" human function, and on top of that some of my family often calls me useless because of the way they affect me. I am already in my mid 20s with a niche associate's degree my only accomplishment, I cannot find work to even be like, a cashier or something, I still live at home. No one wants me, not a job, not certain family, including my mom and sister who are the ones to call me useless. To top it all off, my dog is one of the only things that keeps me in it all the time, and now those two are threatening to get rid of her because I am almost out of money, and they think I will not be able to care for her anymore, when I would do anything to care for her, no matter how I have to get money. I need her. I have a very small bit saved up and it is all going to her while I still look for work. So tonight I picked up a knife, thought about how to do it, and... I just cannot seem to follow through. what is wrong with me? I cannot even end it right. So why am I posting at all? Because the thoughts have gotten stronger and stronger over the years, a combo of an anti depressant and therapy is not helping enough, and I feel like something is about to push me over the edge.

"I am a 27m, Pansexual, and Autistic. Growing up, I was bullied alot, but I can recall having happy moments, even happy moments with my mother, but as I grew, my mother and I started to become more argumentative and hostile, and drastically effected my mental standing. Everyday was mental struggle to find happiness, and I would always retreat to my room with my video games and anime, and it helped me ignore it, but then came the Dark Day, an argument so drastic, that I had to kick myself out, to my wife's (girlfriend then) house. For awhile, I felt great! My mother's hostility felt like the Moon from Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, and leaving finally made it disappear. Come Present day, my anxiety had risen, things are harder to enjoy, and negative thoughts ruminate to the point where I cannot have a day with out hearing my mother's voice or imagining terrible scenarios around my screw-ups and it is affecting my relationship with my wife (who battles against depression, and is possibly autistic). I feeling like I am losing the war for my mind, and thoughts of running away to not bother anyone ever again CONSTANTLY creep up. This has spiraled into beast that just will not die.

"So I only have one sister, and growing up I have seen how different we are raised. As the eldest I am expected to learn all the household stuff, do them quietly and perfectly. But when my sister was at the age where she should have learned and done the stuff I did my mother never forced her to do any stuff (it is the culture but really? how fair is that?) Mom would also guilt trip me whenever I refused to do my sister's homework or project.I spotted a lot of difference as we grow older. Whenever their is conflict between me and my sister, no matter whose fault it was, they will side with her. Sometimes my father would just stay quiet because mom would get mad at him. that is why right now my sister thinks that she has the authority over me especially if I would defend or in their term ""retaliate"" to my parents. I am just tired with how things are at home.Just recently my sister and I fought, I am partly at fault because of my temper and I am just tired of them not remembering any of my preferences (they forget even the smallest thing about me.) I knew I am at fault too but for her to use the stuff that I fought over with my bf (she overheard it) during our fight is below the belt. so I told her that she has no right to use that against me. She burts out and threw things at me. She also tried to charged at me only to be held back by my mom. I do not know what to do anymore. I do not even have a safe space at home.

"Small context: To anyone who is curious I am 16 years old 1. It feels hard to express my opinion on the internet because every time I do I always get bashed for it. I am starting to doubt myself, am I the problem? What is it that I say that turns people against me? I swear I try my best to stay respectful and not offend anyone.. I swear their words get to me easily2. I hate my body and my looks so much. Literally every girl I see on the internet looks prettier than me. I see a lot of girls on the internet who do not look like they alter their photos but idk if they do.. nonetheless it makes me feel terrible to be this ugly. I cannot even look at myself in the mirror for longer than 5 seconds.. I do not even want to leave the house anymore because I hate how I look. I am considering getting surgery to fix my face but at the same time I am too scared to do it3. I feel like an idiot for being slow and not understanding many things I see. I want to be a part of the conversation but I am too afraid to ask because I might get bullied for not understanding something. 4. I suffer from a lot of health issues and most of my health problems are on my skin which makes me insecureAll of these reasons are taking a toll on me, ik my problems might not sound as bad as other problems which makes me feel bad about myself, I feel like a spoiled brat complaining about problems that might sound unrealistic, I am sorry if it sounds that way I am trying to be a better person and get over things because I am told to just get over it so I am trying but its hard At this point, the suicidal thoughts are carved into my head, they just will not go away, it feels like I could escape them for a short time if I harm myself maybe I keep having suicidal thoughts all day everyday for multiple reasons",Suicidal
"I think I have been depressed for a little over 5 years now, and as I am returning to the world due to COVID winding down in my area, I am starting to see how the isolation and negative thoughts are affecting me physically and emotionally. I finally went to get my drivers license a little less than a month ago, and on the way to take the road test I just started feeling awful, like I the weight of the world was bearing down on me, slowly crushing me. I felt my limbs go numb and the urge to vomit was creeping in along with tears beginning to cloud the edges of my vision. I have never felt as out of control of my body as I did that day it was definitely a first for me. I have never had a good outlet for all the feelings I suppress, and its awful to feel that you cannot trust those closest to you; I love my parents deeply, but I cannot trust them with the truth and it would only make them worry. Oddly I have found that self flagellation helps calm my mind, I get no pleasure from it, and I do not beat myself bloody, but pain helps me focus and take my mind away from darker trains of thought. I am going to be applying for a job in a few days and that is what is currently the main source of stress in my life right now.

"I am just so done, honestly. The last two years have been shit, I was forced out of a job, suffered horrendously from bullying from my past two employers, have been in therapy from it, worked up the courage to get another job, my role was cut by 30 hours a week and have been looking for work ever since, I am so broke.

"Not sure if this is the right place for this or really why I am sharing.I (26 M) have been dealing with depression for as long as I can remember really. The past couple of years though it started to take over my life and cripple me in every aspect. I have built a decent comfortable life with a beautiful house, a dog that we absolutely adore, decent reliable vehicles, decent job, lots of friends to go out and have get togethers with. All with a beautiful supportive wife to enjoy it with. I do not say all that to brag, just to show some perspective I guess. I have all I could theoretically want or need, but yet I was so depressed that I dreaded waking up every day. I would lay at home by myself and drink and stare at the ceiling for hours just absolutely miserable for no reason. I started to self medicate with alcohol because it seemed the only thing that helped. As long as I kept a buzz going, I felt a little better. Of course this led to a vicious cycle of alcohol making my depression worse, and me drinking more to treat my depression. I started to drink all day on most days. Not getting hammered most of the time but drinking just enough to ride that buzz to feel a little better. I could not muster up the motivation to go to work allot of days. Luckily I have a very lenient boss and a decent amount of PTO at work or else I would have lost my job a year ago or longer. It felt like the end of the world to have to get up and go to work being in such a miserable state already, so I became known as the guy who calls out all the time. He is lazy and does not want to come to work. Some days I had to get drunk just to be able to numb my head, to be able to go to work, so I started drinking before work almost every day. I had brain fog so bad that it almost felt like depersonalization disorder. could not think, could not concentrate on what people were saying to me or on a task that I had to do. My short term memory was so bad that everyone of my friends and coworkers began to notice. (I once asked a friend if he had ever ate at this new restaurant, to which he replied dude I was literally there with you yesterday.) I suffered for so long like this without even talking about it with my wife. I could tell she knew something was wrong but we never talked about it. She was always supportive to which I am so thankful for. I tried everything to try to get out of my depression. I started researching and reading books on depression and different types of therapy that is used for treatment. I changed my diet a couple of times. Cut this out or that out. Cut back on drinking. Take a daily vitamin. Natural seratonin increase pills. Started working out 6 days a week (which actually seemed to help more than anything else I tried.) All of this and I was still depressed most of the time. I would have a day or two out of the week that were good days, if you could call it that. On those days, I would convince myself that I am just being lazy about going to work and that I am being dramatic. Everything is going good in life. You have no reason to be depressed. You have no reason to be depressed! I told myself this and was told this by anyone who I mentioned my depression to. I fucking hate that response so much. If I have no reason to be, then why am I so depressed then?! So three months ago is when my life finally started to change. I finally forced myself to go see a psychiatrist, after multiple appointments made and chickening out of going. He put me on the generic form of lexapro. I am sure you guys here are familiar with it. It started to help some a few weeks in, but I was still having good and bad days. We upped the strength of the medication and holy moly, what difference! I mean, I am now at almost an entire month without one single day being depressed. I have not called out of work. I am motivated and have been doing extra stuff that I do not absolutely have to do in my job. I have been more motivated at home, with keeping the house up and stuff. (Did I mention that I let my yard get so bad that I had to pay someone $1,200 dollars to come get it back to a manageable state.) I am actually starting to feel emotions again, not just dead and empty. My wife has noticed a big change in me as well and it makes me so happy that she notices the change. That constant feeling of doom and dread is justgone, and I am actually starting to feel like a human again. My drinking has also slowed WAY down because I am no longer using it to numb my feelings. I am still dealing with brain fog and some memory issues, but I am hoping they get better with time. I guess the reason for me writing this long story, that many people will not even bother to read all the way through, is to let anyone here that has been suffering and have not tried medication because of whatever reason know to Just try it! It may just change your life. Depression is hard and it seems like no one who has not actually dealt with it understands at all. It makes you feel like you are crazy sometimes. To anyone reading this, the way you are feeling is VALID and you are not being dramatic! Good luck on your journey through the darkness all! Lexapro saved my life!",Depression

"I am a 24 yo male. All throughout my life, I feel like I ""peaked"" really early on, and either through self-induced calamity, circumstance, or a combo of both came crashing down. Even though I have not lived a long time, I already experienced a long term relationship, sex, life abroad, college, and some recognition. I realize how lucky I had been for to actually tick off those moments. But my relationship ended because I became self-grandiose and deemed myself ""settling"" for someone below me, whatever the hell that meant at the time. My life abroad ended because I forgot or was too nonchalant to file in some paperwork crucial to my legal standing. I have realized my BA and MS degrees, even though acquired from top universities, do not mean shit, when there were apparently thousands of software programs that I should have been mastering instead of wasting my time passing a ""Introduction to Beer"" GE course in college. I remember I used to be extremely motivated and driven up until three, four years ago. I always deemed it my best quality, that I could find the motivation from within. But ever since those times, I have just kept falling further and further away from what a subjective optimal human life from should be. I find it hard to be motivated to do most everyday tasks. I have grown a dislike for people. I think I have finally realized the superficiality of modern society, or at least the segment that I know. And everything seems extremely pointless. I have not had a job since grad school, and have not had a relationship after my said breakup. I might just have grown lazy. Or I might be severely depressed. Now lucky for the leech that I am, my expenses are, and will be for some time I think, paid for. And if I do not make some stupid mistakes, like getting married or adopting a baby or starting a business, or in any way do not add anyone or anything to the payroll, I could retire to a small bungalow in the country and meagerly live out the rest of my life without working or engaging with the society. I might grow into an alcoholic with a severed lung, but that is a bet I am going to have to make. I am not posing a question here. I am just writing down what I have been seriously thinking about for the past couple of months, and I want to know your opinion on it.

I do not want this to happen, I have no hopes or dreams but I still have a family that would miss me. I feel so trapped and lost I cannot think straight. I wish it would get better.

"My life is very hard. I am in pain all the time. I have been working on healing for years and there is been some improvement but overall I am still in bad shape. I can usually only sleep during the day. I play chess but my pain really affects my game and its really disappointing. I play guitar but have really low quality gear because I have no money. I live with my parents. I cannot work at all and my disability claim was denied. I sent it in an appeal, hoping for the best. Its always hard being around my father. It seems like hes so disappointed in me and it creates a very tense atmosphere. Its easier to be around my mom but its still hard. My older brother blew up at me a few weeks ago telling me how lazy I am. He does not believe I have a disability. He was incredibly insulting. I blocked him but he apologized so I am talking to him again. Hopefully it will stay civil. My younger brother is nice but does not really understand my situation. I spend all my time either at home or at the park a few feet from my house. I tried to get gas the other day but was too anxious. I drove by the gas station and went back home. My mental health has never been decent. In 2013 my physical health began doing downhill. One issue after another. No help from any of the many doctors I tried. I smoked weed every day from 12 to 18 to try and cope with my issues. When I got sober a lot of the people I thought were my friends wanted little to nothing to do with me. College was terrible. I dropped out my senior year. Every year got harder and harder since my health was declining. Then I moved back in with my parents and it was doctor after doctor, protocol after protocol. None of it helped. It generally just made things worse and Id voice this to my parents and it caused more tension. I was kicked out of the house countless times and often slept at motel 6 with the money I had at the time. I have had such a bizarrely difficult life. I have been expressing suicidal ideation since 3rd grade. I keep hoping things will pick up for me and that Ill finally reach a place where I feel stable. I have hopes and dreams. Well see what happens. Thanks for reading. All the best to you Tanner A difficult life",Depression
"I doubt I would fail if I attempted, but the idea terrifies me. I have a feeling my mom would already be gone by the time I came to, or at least very close. My best friend would lose their sober streak and probably start drinking again. I would be left paralyzed or unharmed but left with regret and I would probably just wish for death more than I do now.Of course that is not the only thing stopping me, I would feel selfish for leaving everyone I care about. I hate the idea that suicide is selfish but I feel that way to myself. I only care about two people in this world and I know they would be fucked up if I were gone. I know for sure one would follow in my footsteps and the other would probably kill themself with self-destructive habits.I just wish I could be free of this life.

"For the last two years I have struggled with hardcore depression, which was only made worse because I feel like my life has been pretty great so why do I feel so bad. Everyone else I know has been through so much and I think they look down on me for it. I dropped out of college during my first year because of it. Two months ago now me and my best friend of 9 years stopped talking for good, and while our relationship was toxic looking back I just feel worthless. I am going back to school this semester, I have been getting into old hobbies, I have a dog which probably saved my life multiple times, and my family is pretty great. But I have no friends whatsoever. I have pushed everyone away or everyone is left me, I feel like I waste my days online and I just do not know what to do. I want to make friends so badly when I go back but she will be there and everyone else who has walked out on me. I am not medicated though I have been but I do not feel like awful as I have a few months ago. But I do feel a void. I do not ever hang out with anyone and I am just lonely. I do not feel like I have anyone to do anything with, and its been making me a nervous wreck.

"Not necessarily in this community, although I have seen it here before, but just in general. Someone will post in or speak about how they overcame their suicidal urges and their depression in groups of people who are all depressed and suicidal; take all the congratulations and ""I am proud of you""'s but never explain how the achieved it or give advice or even RESPOND to people asking them how they did it.Now I know nobody is entitled to anyones story, but when you dangle it in front of people who could reall use its faces, it just feels so cruel yknow? Like someone from a poor neighborhood returning to their home rich and successful and they never tell their old friends and fanily or even just people in the neighborhood who NEED it how they did it. They just stand around in the neighborhood to be admired and praised and when someone asks them how they got to that point they either ignore them or give them that same half assed vauge ""it gets better"" answer. Its good that you overcame your illness. Its good that you decided to not kill yourself or your attempt failed and you decided to live and work on getting better. Congratulations.

"IDK if this is the right sub. to post this but its one of the few that I think will actually accept a post like this and something I need to get off my chest.&amp;#x200B;Anyway, I am 23 years old and have Aspergers (high functioning Autism). When I went to college (started ""real life"") is really where my life started to fall apart. In general, from speaking to others this is a pretty common occurence for most people on the spectrum and other developmental disorders as such. &amp;#x200B;In realizing how much it impacted me, I certainly went through the stages of grief. Now I feel I am at the phase of acceptance in that I realize that there is no magic cure and its something I will have to live with. That being said, I do not side with the general Aspie community it seems with the opinion that the development of pre-natal scanning for Autism for aborting is obscene and wrong. Not only that, but I strongly encourage it. I do not think it should be required to abort them but I do certainly think that REAL education of what its like raising a kid with Aspergers/Autism is like as well as the obstacles they face. &amp;#x200B;At the end of the day, there are VERY few parents who I think can properly and effectively parent a child with it. I even tell my parents that I think you are good parents but not good parents for me (AKA somebody with Autism/Aspergers) but that I do not blame them for it because it should not be expected of them. I do not think the parents should be stigmatized for it but at the same time its not fair to the kid.&amp;#x200B;Not to mention the world in general is admittedly not structured for those on the spectrum. I guess you could argue that its possible for some to adapt but at the end of the day I do not really see the point of knowingly having a child who you know ahead of time is going to immensely struggle to blend in society (hence why I encourage abortion in most cases). &amp;#x200B;A commonly asked question I see is why do we only ever see children with developmental conditions advertised/in media. At the end of the day, its because adulthood is almost always bleak. ""Institutions"" are still a VERY real thing. Lower functioning Autism, Down Syndrome, mentally retarded, etc. kids are still very much sent off when their parents no longer can/feel like taking care of them. I know the common belief in society is that the handling of mental illness until recently was very poor and everybody was just institutionalized, well, its the same thing now. The only difference is that they can live their childhood at home and with their peers before being sent off. &amp;#x200B;Conditions like Aspergers are not much less bleak. Most are able enough to not be sent to an institution but most companies outright refuse to hire those on the spectrum, the unemployment rate is ridiculously high, many jobs require skills Aspies do not naturally have. Most end up in poorly paid jobs reserved for those with ""disabilities"" or doing something else of little respect. I am actually personally looking into doing sex work.&amp;#x200B;I certainly do not see myself committing suicide at this point (although if assisted suicide becomes available I would take it). Although I think a real part of accepting my condition is realizing that I am not all that special and can now more clearly see and accept the fact that Aspergers/Autism just does not work. I will say that one benefit (there are not many) is I do think I am a bit less judgemental after realizing how Aspergers/Autism impacts me. I can now more clearly see that jobs like sex work are no less respectable than any other company and have more respect for those workers and realizing that there is no shame in what they are doing. I feel like part of the acceptance stage (final step in stage of grief) should be admittance to want of death",Suicidal

"I spent 2 hours writing a post on here until my phone glitched and deleted it all. Then I realized I was over sharing &amp; decided not to type it all out again. It was good therapy venting to myself anyways.7 months ago my newborn son passed away, 2 days before his 1 month birthday. He stopped breathing in his sleep, spent 9 hours at ER &amp; then passed away in my husband &amp; Is arms. I thought I was doing better but these past few weeks have been miserable. I was told prior to conceiving him (and after 4 miscarriages) that I had pcos and probably would never be able to conceive or have a pregnancy success. I found out two days before Mothers Day 2020 that I was having him &amp; I named him after Gabriel the messenger of God. He was the most amazing thing to ever happen to me and the most beautiful thing I had ever seen in my life. I wish every day I was the one who died instead of him.I am only 20 years old, yet I feel as if I have been through so much. I feel like God is punishing me in my life and I can never be happy. I do not understand why he had to cut short the life of a beautiful baby. I cannot eat, I am always tired, I am always reliving the moment my husband runs into our room screaming hes not breathing.Every night I fall asleep to images of what I think he would look like now. I am trying to conceive again to no avail. I want to be a mother so badly but no other baby will be like him, and my body will not cooperate regardless. I do not want to kill myself but I feel like I have nothing to live for anyways.He saved my from a severe eating disorder &amp; addiction. He made me grow up and turned me into a woman. I moved out, I got my shit together, my husband and I got married so my baby could have a happy home.I will never get to see him take his first steps, say momma for the first time, get to give him his first taste of sugar.

"I always thought how can you call suicidal people cowards? It takes so much bravery to actually hurt yourself and all that jazz. Well today, while i was dabbling in self pity, i realized that the main reason i am suicidal is that i am afraid of the future. I am afraid of taking responsibilities. I am afraid of facing this shitty life alone. I am afraid of stepping up and becoming a functional human being. I am afraid of taking on the responsibility of livingI have a few things i want to see happen, but i do not have any other reason to stay in ~1 year, and many reasons not to stay.

"I have struggled with anxiety and depression for 10 years. For the most part I managed it, and I had a decent life and support system. But the past few years everything in my life has gone completely downhill. Its been one thing after another, and just when I think it cannot get any worse, it does. It started when I began to get panic attacks every day, and my social anxiety took a deep dive in college. I dropped out, and have only managed a few classes since then. My mom started having vision problems 3 years ago due to a negligent doctor that failed to inform her that the corneal disease she is had since a teen was rapidly progressing. I have watched her go to all these top specialists week after week for 3 years, and every treatment option has failed. she is always been my best friend and my rock. Watching her go through this, unable to do anything has been horrible. But recently, her mental health took a big turn for the worse. I have had to call 911 on her twice to get her to a psych hospital in the past 3 months. she is truly the only person I have left though. 2 of my closest family members died unexpectedly, the rest of my family does not give a fuck despite my efforts to reach out, my dad is the worst of them all, and I have lost all my friends. I am absolutely terrified for my mom, and I wish so bad I could do something to actually help her. But selfishly, my mental health is at an all time worse. I have never felt more alone and scared in my life, I think about suicide every minute, and I have come up with a plan. I am 23 with no college degree, barely any work history, with no hope for an actual future. I have lost the one person I could got to about anything, because I cannot burden my mom with everything she is going through. I see a therapist every week and it has been zero help. She recommended a residential therapy program for a month, which I feel like is worth a try but the problem is I cannot leave my mom. She has enough vision to do basic things, but she cannot drive, and she needs me right now. No one else in our family understands or cares enough to even call her. I feel so trapped, so hopeless, so terrified. I know that makes me a selfish person, I know I need to suck it up and help my mom. But fuck I do not know how I can keep going like this. I do not see any other way out",Suicidal

"I am so depressed.The thing is, growing up I had high dreams for myself.Really high dreams.I was lucky in the sense that I was born with talents. I could sing and grew up being praised for my voice. I was a fabulous writer who thrived off books and poetry. As I got into my teen years I began to love fashion. I could have been a singer, or a writer or even a fashion designer.I could have had friends. Fun, hilarious and artistic friends like me. And instead, I became none of those things I so desperately loved. I do not have any friends because I am pretty different and I do not find it easy to click with people that often, especially in the town I ended up living in.I am 31 and I have a daughter who I adore and love more than life itself. But I still cannot help but feel cheated out of the life I felt I knew I was meant to have.When I hear music, sometimes I cry just thinking about how I wanted to do that. If I see a woman thriving in her writing career,Well.. you guessed it!

"So as title states. I had ran out of medication. I tried to get it refilled , made a few calls to my psychiatrist office left a couple messages. Even spoke to someone days before it supply ran out. But in the end it was not refilled. Mind you I had not had an appointment since maybe January as I missed my last telephone appointment sometime in spring I believe. I was on the max dose of the prescription , I had been on this since the end of 2017 although my dose was not maxed out till around the start of 2019 if I recall correctly. I had been skipping doses here and there but never more than 2 days at a time sometimes I would forget if I had taken my dose for the day and most times I elected not to take said possible missed dose for that day in the event that I did take it. So I am wondering what to expect in the coming weeks or months. Mind you I have a lot of other mental impairments aside from severe depression and bipolar. Some I do not even know anything about. I am currently not sleeping too much , it is a lot more difficult to fall asleep now. I am having brain shocks and what not often. I feel like I used to prior to taking this medication. Extreme tiredness , slurring my words often , not feeling alive at all. (Even on the medication I felt tired and weak but it was not as bad as it is while off it)I wake up early now and after being up maybe .. 5 hours I start to feel so tired and have 0 energy but cannot nap/sleep While off the medication , if I go for a walk or exercise I get this high and feel like I can do anything (lol) while on medication I did not really get that even after doing those activities. This is a lot to read and I am sure I confused anyone who has made it this far. But I am hopeful to get some kind of response. (I have an appointment with a new mental health professional in 2 weeks) if that matters I ran out of Citalopram about 8 or so days ago. what is going to happen?",Depression

"I have been close to my friend for four years, in the friendship I was constantly apologizing for the mistakes that were not my own. We got in a lot of fights, mostly about respecting each other, since he never respected me. I made mistakes in the friendships, he made some overly bad mistakes. I was so scared of losing my friendship it ended up hurting me in the end. Throughout the friendship, I helped him so much, paid for so much, bought him things to make him happy, and helped him with a girl that he loved for so long, just so he could be happy. So many things, because a part of me thought he was going to be my best friend for life, and I was manipulated a lot throughout the friendship. Fast forward near our graduation, he gave me covid-19, and throughout covid 19, my dad passed away when I got symptoms, and I had to be locked in a small room throughout, and I never got to see my dad in his last moments/ when he passed. I stood in a room shaking, and that same idea torment's my soul, and has just weighed a huge amount of anxiety towards me. When I had covid, he would not let me tell any of our friends, he kept saying how it will ruin the friendship between me and him, and others. I was threatened, and vulnerable during the situation as my dad was currently in the hospital in critical condition. The only thing keeping me sane throughout the process that we were still friends, and he knew the most about my dad and I could talk to him. Throughout this incident, a month later he ended up cutting me off for reason's that I regret, but summary was he talked shit about me to make people hate me, and basically it was a situation between how these people hated eachother, and forced it upon me and him, and basically the two girls manipulated him the entire time to hate the two girls. At the end it switched up on me for the wrong reasons, lies were being told. In the end my friend basically got mad for bringing up his name and he told me to go kill myself, and told me I deserve everything that is happening to me. Now it continues that I am losing my other friends, I have fallen into depression, and he is slowly making everyone hate me. The only thing keeping me sane was being able to talk to people and distract myself, but nothing has gone good. Every single week something worse happens, and I just do not want to be on this planet anymore. I do not want to go throughout life, my life is over, my dad is gone, and everything is just garbage. It comes to the point where I cannot even explain this situation because it is so long, and it is so fucked up. I just wan't to be happy again, but i will truly never find happiness.

"When I was younger, in my childhood, I had self worth, I still had anxiety, but I felt like I was the best at everything. I was a ""gifted"" child and did well in school, in fact my only main source of anxiety was if my crush liked me back. Either way I felt special and unique. I have had worrying behavior before where I would cut myself with school scissors and even younger as a toddler, I would bang my head against the wall or floor. Still. Those things were rare of me though maybe I should I have taken it as a sign of things to come. In middle school I was anxious but I still felt nice and special. 9th grade was when things changed though, I started to get bullied which made me reevaluate myself, I started seeing myself in a negative light, and the only way I coped was sleep or being in a constant state of self loathing. There were times I made threats to the students that were bullying me, but instead of thinking it was wrong, I doubted my capabilities to go through with the threat. After 9th grade I felt better going to another high school, I was not getting bullied, and even though I was not quickly making friends, people still let me hang around them or sit at their table. It was nice. I met my ex boyfriend not too long after and we stayed together for 3 years. He ended up leaving me during my first semester of college. I felt sad about it, but having been in a relationship for 3 years gave me a false sense of security that finding another relationship might be easy. I was quite wrong. Not only that but I started to realize many people were better than me and were skilled at something while I realized I was not. I was quite literally not good at anything or at least not good enough. However, this world requires you to contribute something to it. I could not. The former gifted child felt lied to. That I could do anything and I had great potential. It bothered me a lot. I did not feel like I could conquer anything like I used to. Instead, I was smacked in the face with the truth that I was not special and my best was not good enough. Through this period people kept telling me to keep trying and I eventually will get good. I did not see any improvement, in some areas I felt like I was getting worse. Right now I am stuck with the feeling of inferiority and suicidal thoughts. I am not quite doing anything for this world, in a way I feel like I am taking up space that could be used for a much more skilled and intelligent individual. Recently I looked through documents of tests that were done when I was younger in elementary school. I found that I lacked critical thinking skills and had a language disorder as well as anxiety. I thought my IQ may have been better but I tested below average for verbal iq and only slightly above average for non verbal with the highest in calculating. Right now I am not sure how to move forward... but I am too scared to kill myself. I have never been good enough. .",Suicidal

I have never been to prison but I just cannot stop thinking about how soul-shattering that experience would be.

But I am still angry and I feel killing myself is the only way to win the argument I feel, having failed at anything in life the only I can have the final word or any control is to kill my self - successfully. A failed attempt will only make me more of a failure. I mean I know there has to be a better way to deal with this I just do not know how. Confrontation will not help, Ill just sound more desperate. Staying my true feelings about everything to everyone will not help Ill just embarrass and maybe isolate myself more. I can discuss with a counsellor but that often just feels like talking. Its not an solution its not even leading to one. People only take action, especially irreversible violent action, seriously.

I had to cancel the day before my trip, actually day of, as I was on the phone for that long trying to cancel and recoup everything.

I can understand why they want to do that , people here , all neighbours , judge a lot, and they are going to make your life harder in a society if you are not what they wanted, and I have to pretend , which is not enough and always end up getting teased by those extroverts.

Their comments are always homophobic , sexist, illogical , and it is also about me sometimes, which are generally misleading and wrong, even of my parents , they scold me for wrong reasons most of the time and the explanation I have , which might have / will change their mind ends up in my mind.it is not just about home , even in school , I am so shy , I am not able to answer anything or justify myself and end up getting scolded for reasons I was not supposed to.Some people might say just speak what is on your mind , how hard is it? , Damn it is hard for me , and I am not sure why , everytime I take a long breath to talk , I end up exhaling it and not talk anything.

I just wish my death would not be as much of a burden as my life has been.How nice it would be to just pop away, to erase my debts and traces of my life as if I was never here to begin with. I know so many people fear the very idea of the end. But at this point I am either numb to the aspect of it or almost in a way dream of that time finally coming. I mean I could remember a time dreaming of what it might be like to finally be better, to find the joy and wonders of life--which I mean I can appreciate and all, but there is also this sort of tarnish that constantly smudges everything when you have to live like this. That nothing can ever be good for too long. That things that bring you down have to roll over again and again until you just stop fighting and just become the punching bag that everything seems to zero in on. And maybe that is what the idea of death inviting in it is own way. That once you enter that dark abyss there just is not anything anymore. No terrible things to constantly remind you of how worthless you are, no good things that always perks up that joy and hope no matter how in vain you know it is, just waiting for them to be ripped away again like they always are.Just a peaceful empty where I can fade away into nothing, where I can stop being a burden to everyone around me. But until then I guess I will just have to stick to dreaming. A mistake of a life",Suicidal
"There is someone very close to me with depression and i have no idea how to respond when they vent to me, I have never been good with handling other peoples feelings and I do not want them to think I am dismissing their feelings, I really do care about them and I feel bad when they trust me enough to vent and I am just speechless.

"I do not like where I am at in this point of my life. I do not even like looking at myself anymore. I feel uncomfortable with looking at myself. I am so stressed from everything going on at home. I do not want to be here to live through it. Its kind of a pussy move, but I am over it. I had confidence - and now its being taken away from me again. I do not have the energy to cry either . I just want to go to sleep.I know I make these posts like all the time but its like I cannot do anything for myself anymore. I do not want to look at myself. I hate myself.

"So I have literally not done an entire course's worth of work and I am most likely going to fail this semester if I cannot turn in the homework by the end of this week, but I have not worked on it even a littleI do not understand why I cannot get anything done and yet I continue to do it, I always am just in time for appointments, just in time to get to work, and barely late for assignments. I cannot seem to get a foothold no matter how hard I try to, because no matter what I am barely scraping by. I have no free time because the rest of it is filled with worry.I work part time and do school full time, and it makes me want to die, not only literally but figuratively as well. I can literally feel the pain in my soul when I put off the assignment, the quiz, the test, and eventually, the class. It hurts so goddamn much you would not believe, but then I go ahead and just do it to myself again.I see it as something almost akin to climate change, as depressing as that sounds. Like the worst part about this inescapable loop, is that it is inherently completely avoidable if I simply did the work. But I cannot bring myself to do it so I do not know what to do, and every second of inaction is another assignment missing, so I am watching my possibilities burn with fear as I stand like a deer in the headlights. &amp;#x200B;I am powerless to my inability to work and I cannot strive nor see myself striving to do anything other than work.

"my brother has not spoken to our mother in over 10 years and he just started speaking(texting) to me again after ghosting me for 3 years. I was listening to music and a song came on that always made me think of our family situation. I did not think he would even listen or reply but he did and he sent me back a song that must have been on his heart with the situation and knowing that is how he feels breaks my heart. Growing up we were abused. When he would be the one on the receiving end of the abuse it always broke me to see my big, strong, charismatic, athletic brother have such a deep sadness but the kind you can only recognize if you have felt the same way. No tears or screaming..just brokenness. I have recovered from my childhood very well considering. However that small interaction with my brother the other day has really brought back a lot of feelings. I adore my brother while on the other hand I have made the decision to forgive our mother and that is something that will always put a strain on our relationship. We went from being so so close to now me having a 2.5y/o he is never even met even though I have invited him many times. He also agreed to come meet her on her birthday and canceled 20min before he was supposed to be here. He told me that the only way he feels like he can be okay is to be independent and prove to himself he does not need anyone. Me on the other hand feels like in order for me to be okay i need to hug my brother and tell him i love him and see him be an uncle to my baby :( so basically I have been crying since monday and thinking about how i do have unresolved anger towards our mom and maybe i need to talk to her about how i feel, but I have felt fine with everything for awhile until finding out how hurt my brother still is a vent post, triggering convo w/ brother",Depression
"All I have to do is browse the reddit comments. ""You look like mom's neck beard basement dweller"", ""I would date your second chin"". And I think that some of these ""roasts"" could apply to me. I am a woman. I have been told I am attractive. I think I am. I only weigh 110 lbs and I am 5'6"". But I still have excess weight I gained after losing a pregnancy and being put on birth control. So the double chin comment really gets to me. Everytime I see a negative comment, I think about how my closest friends could say or think the same thing about me. Especially since one of my closer guy friends is a guy I crushed on, recently told and got rejected by in the nicest way possible. I have trust issues. I sometimes think I am not as great as I think I am in the moment. That my friends are internally roasting me in their heads while I look like an egotistical, arrogant, a-hole. Thank you for coming to my ted talk. Today's been rough. I have been struggling with suicidal ideation ever since I flirted with my guy friend again and made things akward. It seemed like he was flirting at first but I think I misperceived the intent in his speech and screwed up again. there is more to this story but I do not want to get into it. I cannot tell if I am overthinking, paranoid and waiting for betrayal or if my intuition is on to some things. So I deacti everything. I am staying away.

"I feel like I have always had one sided friendships. like I am always the one who puts in all the work. And it sucks because it used to hurt less. When I was a kid, before I moved for the first time, friendships were easy. My best friend lived a few houses down and wed have sleepovers all the time. we did not have phones so we would talk and hangout during recess and on the weekends. and then I moved. and I was the weird new kid. it took me three years to make friends. and just when I started to fit in, we moved again. and again, I was the weird new kid. I would somehow find my way into friend groups that were already established. but because they would known each other forever, they never included me in anything. because I was not really one of them. I bounced around friend groups for 3 years. until I met the new weird girl. we bonded over how shitty moving was and we made fast friends. we are still best friends more than 10 years later. we made our own friend group and it was nice. but she graduated 2 years before I did. and the year after she left, my friend group changed. we took in two freshman that seemed to hate me for no other reason than I was the defacto leader. they thought they were hot shit and gossiped and lied and turned my friends against me. except one. and I was... okay. I had other friends and spent time on the sidelines in their friend groups. but then they all graduated. or moved. and it was just me and a school full of people who either hated me or did not know I existed. I was facing senior year alone and with the worst schedule I had ever seen a senior have. so I dropped out. cut off all my hair. attended the local community college to get my GED. kept my head down mostly. did not really make friends. after I got my GED I kept taking classes. nothing in particular, just general stuff. edged my way into more friend groups. again, they never made plans with me. but I was used to it. I did my own thing. and I was ok. I had a job then. and a semi decent boyfriend. I wasted two years in college and never got enough credits to even really count as half a year. dropped out. lost all my school friends when I stopped going to school. worked and spent time with my boyfriend. life was good I had my best friend who hung out with me all the time, a good job, and a semi decent boyfriend. and then we broke up. and my parents moved. so I moved. in with a man twice my age in a state id never been to. and he went to work in Alaska. left me alone in a house with four animals to look after, a job that gave me four hours a week and a freezer full of burritos. i made one friend that was a good friend. kept me company when I needed it. washed my dishes if I made him food. took me out places. he was probably the only reason I am still alive. then the man who is house I lived in came back. I somehow managed to get back with my ex in that time and I moved with my parents to another state id never been in. the friend who would saved me stopped texting. stopped responding. after six months of no friends and no job, I moved back to my ""hometown"" to be with my boyfriend. who kicked me out in less than a month. so I lived with my sister. and her two kids, husband and fil. slept on a cot in my niece's room. eventually broke up with my boyfriend. worked too many hours in a job that sucked and did not have time or money to make friends. in a desperate move, I moved in with a new partner. to a different state. this one I would at least visited. I got a job. we had nice roommates. everything was nice. until my partner had a mental breakdown. moved out. left me alone where I could not afford the rent. so I moved across the country, back to my parents. where I live still. I have been here for two years. no job. a wonderful boyfriend who loves me and one friend. that never reaches out if I do not reach out first. never wants to spend time with me unless I ask. and suddenly I am back in middle school. a depressed fuck with no real friends, no motivation and a the biggest wish to have never existed in the first place. shitty friends are the worst. I do not even try anymore. I do not want to try anymore. I want to fade into the background until no one remembers I ever existed. If you are reading this, know that I do not want to die. I do not want to stop living. my death would be too painful to people I care about. I would never do that to them. but if a genie came to me and gave me one wish, I would ask to have never been born. obviously, there is a lot more going on that fuels my depression but this is the most prevalent right now. Rant. Down in my feels tonight. it is a long one.",Depression
"Before I really wanted to be happy, i know it is not just something you can get but i was tired of being depressed all the time. At this point, I do not even want to be happy anymore. It seems like too much of a mess and too much effort for something that will not even last. I feel like i have already tried so many times to be happy, and none of them worked. Even when I have people that love me, friends, hobbies, life still seemed so shit. Is this just it? At some point i just stopped attempting and accepted that I will never be happy with my life. The only way i see an end to this is suicide, but I am just too scared to do that either. I also know that i will hurt some people if i do die, and in the end, i just feel like I am trapped here with nowhere to go. It makes it all the more frustrating that i hate being here but i cannot just kill myself . I feel like i do not even want to be happy anymore.

They loose more respect for me as the days go by. They say everything is fine but i know they are just trying to be polite. I am a bum. they all no it and none of them like to be around me. I forget important things about their life and barely take care of them or show them love. I have been in a spiral for a while and its heading its peak. The only thing i can do on this fucking earth now is to take care of my mom try to get a good job to support her and that is the only reason I am still here. I am disorganzied, distracted, lazy.

"This evening, like 2 hours ago, I planned my suicide. I planned where I was going to do it, and a few days ago I planned the day that i was going to do it (this friday). But almost 30 minutes ago after I washed my face and cleaned my hair, i feel amazing about myself. This happens EVERY DAY. I get really suicidal because I loose my plans for the future, and because I am very self conscious about my looks, to the point where I have tried to cut my nose to make it look better (but failed). This lasts for about 90 percent of the day, but then at around 10 percent of the day (usually occurring at night) I feel like I am beautifal and that I feel amazing about myself (but I still do not see my future for myself as I lost most of my hopes and hobbies but that does not make me feel any less worst during those times of the day). I have been diagnosed with depression before, but I lied to my therapist because I did not want to get in trouble with my parents and told her I was ok, so in her and my parents eyes it looks to me that I am getting a ton better, (they think I am doing better because I get hella good grades and the best grades out of all my siblings despite having depression) but I am not.

"I have never really felt like I belonged or that anyone really cared about me. My family is very bad at showing affection, praise or even attention. As a child, my parents were too busy working and raising my younger siblings to give me the attention I needed. Fast forward and all my high school friends abandoned me for their significant others. I was the only one who was not in a relationship. there is a reason I do not talk to them anymore. When I turned 21, I met my future wife. We dated for 5 years before I proposed. We married and after 3 years, she wanted out. She lost her attraction to me was her reasoning. She left me in our home and she took our child with her. The only living creature that ever gave me unconditional love was my dog. She was really my only friend the year after my child was born. My wife withheld affection and intimacy from me when I asked for it. I had to put my dog to sleep because she had an inoperable tumor on her heart. After that, I had no one and its where I am today. I am fearful that when I start dating again, I am going be afraid of rejection or possible abandonment. Trust is very hard to come by for me and I am socially anxious to begin with.

"I am 25 years old and I have never had a girlfriend, had sex, ben on a date, kissed, held hands, been touched by, been asked out, etc. I graduated college last May. At my on campus job I became friends with a girl who I eventually fell head over heels in love with.I have been in love with her since 2018. Was rejected and ghosted in 2020. She texted me last year to say hi, I answered and she never answered me back. I cry constantly and have been grieving every day for 3 years.The pain from never being able to be with her has made me suicidal and I have already attempted but failed to hang myself a few times. Its something I have to cope with every day. Its a sickness that never goes away. Its a pain that is not just emotional but physical. Again, I have been dealing with this every single day since fall of 2018.Something this is rooted in is my crush wrote poetry a lot and I bought a copy of a collection she published while we were still friends in 2019. In the collection tehre was a poem about her losing her virginity. Reading that absolutely destroyed me. It kept me awake for days. I could not stand the thought of someone else having sex with someone I loved so dearly and longed to care for so much. One day, she confided in me that her recent ex had been physically abusing her. More pain. Id fantasize about having sex with her but it would not help. I just imagined what it would be like if she actually loved me back and was attracted to me.Its getting to the point where everything related to having sex and relationships in general is painful to me. I even am starting to experience sexual dysfunction: I do not get aroused as easily amd I can no longer watch pornography because it upsets me to see people being intimate because it makes me jealous and depressed that the is something I have never experienced before. I hear people talk about their gfs and wives and I get extremely sad.I found out my 20 year old sister lost her virginity months ago and when I did I cried for days. I felt indescribably disgusting and pathetic. I am 25. I should have lost my virginity first. I should have a gf or wife by now. Everything related to sex and relationships makes me violently depressed. It ruins my day.I am so fucking sick of feeling like this.

"Burner account for obvious reasons.It is so hard to have to seem like I am alright 24/7. Nobody asks me how I am doing. Nobody reaches out to me first. I could go days without meaningful conversation. My childhood was beyond fucked up. My father killed himself and my mother became addicted to drugs. My siblings and I were neglected. I was molested by another kid in the foster home that I stayed at for 2 months, and told nobody because I was ashamed that it happened to me as a male. My siblings and I stayed with our single grandmother for 2 grueling years until she could not take care of 4 children anymore. She sent my two sisters back into foster care, and for that I cannot blame her. I never got to say goodbye so I feel like they died, and there were suddenly less people who truly understood what I have gone through.I finished my last year of middle school and all of high school constantly hiding my depression. Some days are fine and other days are miserable. However, I never let it show how hopeless I was. When my grandmother and I would fight over the smallest things she took me to therapy for a few weeks of my junior year. She thought I had anger issues, but I truly do not so I got diagnosed with an undeclared mood disorder. I just did not want to open up too random stranger about anything. My uncle asked me once in my freshman or sophomore year of high school if I was depressed and I lied and said no. I have not opened up to anyone because, as a male, people are uncomfortable when we show vulnerability. I hate crying in front of others.COVID robbed me of the rest of my senior year of high school. I lost connection with the friends I was making and some of the friends I had. I have never felt more alone in life now than ever. I cannot remember the last time I left the house to spend time with friends. If I stop reaching out nobody will bother to check and see how I am doing. I live a meaningless life and I am expected to suck it up and work a full time job that I dislike very much. I am uncertain of what career path will help me most in my future. My grandmother ensures me that my time at her home is very limited and that it is not a safety net. I am very sure that I will end up killing myself in the near future. My brother already has bipolar depression, so I am worried that if I end my life he will suffer. I know that everyone else that has been in my life will forget about me soon after. They probably hate how closed off I am, but the primary reason I close myself off is to spare them from the pessimism that I keep inside me day to day. I am not going to burden other people with my suffering. So since I am I coward who cannot kill himself, enjoy the vague, depressing (haha) essay that I typed. I just wanted to get this out here so I feel less alone. do not reach out to me to tell me it gets better. Its a shallow phrase used by people lucky enough to have had people who care enter their life. Good for you. I might never come to check if my post was recognized because I really do not care. I just wanted to vent.Sorry for being self centered here. Sorry if some things made no sense.Sorry for wasting your time.I will not end my life anytime soon, but later most likely. I am 19 and already very tired. Thanks for reading I am going to off myself as soon as I get the courage.",Depression

Also, I am sexually active with my girlfriend and I cannot cum - we have had sex probably like twice a week, for the last 2 months, and I have finished exactly 1 time. Its horrible. For a while I could not even get it up. But anyways, that is why I am going off it. What should I do to try to prevent my depression from coming back once I am off it? I am currently in the process of weaning off of Effexor. I am at like half of my dose of 75 mg, planning on cutting that to 0 in 2 weeks or so, once I run out of pills. How do I make sure my depression does not come back after going off of antidepressants?",Depression
"I was a normal good looking guy/teen.Not bragging not like I was a playa or anything but my looks was not a concern. I had active social life and would do things without thinking going parties, nights out, friends etc.Of course lockdown now but this been a few years.In early 20s I notice my hair falling out. I started using sun beds and tanning without suncream because I thought it I go bald I need look dark as white people look sick when bald.My idea was to burn my skin so it is permanently dark.Fast forward a few years not only is my once luxiourios long thick hair half disappeared my face looks like a burns victim. I stopped the sun bathing due to this this my skin is white anyway the irony but all saggy and scarred qnd aged. Fant even hide it with my long hair as I have no long hair so my face is fully visible now. So Combine this with my thin receding hair I have gone from looking like a boy band teen to I am going to some hideous creature.When we people take pics when I have to go out work or family etc restarts they always upload pics without me. The ones with me do not go on Facebook etc...it is obvious they do not want my fuked up face on social media and I do not blame them.Now the issue as a result before covid I avoid everything. No spontaneous life anymore. Going out for 2 or 3 days in a row. Random parties or nights out. I just became a recluse.I need to always carry or wear a hat i couosnt dare sleep over some place now. I live in constant fear over my looks.I hoped lockdown would make me feel less missing out as everyone same boat and time to avoid sun use creams fix my skin improve diet hope hair improve.But over 18 months my hair is worse and face not look any better.Well nobody is going out anyway with covid round here but I still feel my life is fuked because I had it all.I looked normal and had social fun life now I am just constant obsessing and looking mirror qns almost crying.I cannot even look mirror anymore to soul destroying only in dim lights.I cannot believe only some years ago my skin was perfect and hair amazing long.Of course hair loss can happen but I see people grandparents with still nice skin so that is all my stupid fault qnd cannot improve it.Depresses me every day.I eat well workout in good shape I gueas etc but all seems pointless Is it stupid to be suicidal due to appearance",Suicidal
"I have been trying to understand what that compulsion is I felt when I wanted to die. I know this is a tricky question because it would be so deeply personal and individual to everyone, but I am curious if anyone can lucidly explain everything going on during this moment.For me all I remember was there was many terrible things happening to me and I was trying to just go about my regular day and as I was travelling in my wheelchair I stopped. My head was telling me that I needed to drive onto the highway and go in front of the trucks that we are approaching.I just froze and sat in that feeling and those thoughts crying trying to understand what it all was. I had idolised about death and thought about it a lot but that was the first moment where my instincts were telling me to go and do it there and then.Is this similar to everyone else? Just a spiralling of terrible thoughts and Realisations leading to the strong desire to die? Or are there other nuances to it? What is in that moment?",Suicidal
"All my life my family has been toxic and I have always suffered from depression and severe anxiety.. I started cutting around the time I entered middle schoolI turned 19 a month ago but for the past 3 years everything has gotten worse. My older sister emotionally and verbally abuses me and my family. She used to say once I turned 18 she would fight me, I thought about killing myself just to avoid everything. But I did not and now I am 19. I do not want to really get into details but believe me when I say the past 3 years have been hell I am exhaustedmy sister would threaten our lives and her own. Using everything she could against us. We kicked her out many times but she let us herself back in. The police have been to my house thousands of times. I know she struggles with mental issues and she is in pain too but now I am exhausted and my depression and anxiety have worsened. I have recently turned to drugs I am abusing them so badly everyday I get high if I can drink Ill get wasted I have also recently started having sneaky links to feel something. The first time I cried while doing stuff because I know its wrong but I also just do not care.I am self destructing and the worst thing is I am witnessing myself do it and I cannot stop it. I have become so numb to the world around meand when I am actually happy I feel guilty because I know my mom and the kids are sad with the situation.I have wanted to move out but if I do I am leaving them behind to deal with my sisterwell I guess either way Id be leaving them.I do not want to die but I am tired of waking up to this numb feeling. I have medication but I think need something stronger now. Lately I have been having cutting urges.

"I feel like I am falling off the deep end. I do not think I cannot take anymore of this. Nothing I do is useful! I have tried therapy, medication, and try to go on normally. I end up in the same old place every time.I feel terrible about myself. I just want to drop out of college and give up on my dreams. I am not as great as the others, so what is the point in proceeding. Sure, I make good grades, but I do not have any great skill or talents. Everyone around me is so much better than I am, and there is me. Unlike everyone else who is worth something, I am about as valuable as a speck of dust just there to be thrown away.

"So I posted to a group where me and my friends chat about how if I was gone for a long period without talking (2 weeks since I am quite active there) that I was probably dead. The reason being my parents want us to move to the country side with no internet beacause they are conspiracy theorists and such and the internet is basically my only support. And I honestly could not talk to them about my problems and they no way would not move to the country side even if I pleaded on my knees and I honestly do not think I would want to live anymore at that pointI have anger issues and when I get quite angry I have the urge to take a knife and stab myself in the throat and I am quite open about this to my family of course they take it as a joke a little goof a gag a punchline. So they never take it seriously to be honest if we did move I would probably stab myself to death or at least drown myself I could not stand moving so far away from my dreams ambitions and friends like that and at that point I do not see a reason to live my life is already screwed up so I do not see a reason to stay at that point So back to my friends I told them straight up if I am gone for 2 weeks no talking, that I probably killed myself. I wanted them to know this since I did not like the idea of them never knowing what happened to me since I know if i was in they are position that I would want to know why someone so active just stopped posting and I left for bed I came back tomorrow and only one of them said anything out of the 4 friends 1 of them ignored me (maybe did not see the message but be were never all that close) and the other 2 had not posted so I assume they were offline The one that responded did not know how to react and when I checked recently they were panicking asking if anyone saw me online and that they were worried about me and I do not know how to respond staying silent would be a dick move I do not want to make them upset Y'know but at the same time I do not know what to say I cannot promise that I will not kill myself it is the truth I would buy do not like seeing the upset but I do not want them to live on thinking I am okay I am honestly confused I am only 13 and I honestly cannot think of what to say to them.

"How i lost my dad3 years ago, when I was 13 years old, my dad got in to a really bad accident. My dad who was a big sportsman was cycling home from work while training for a upcoming triathlon. Unfortunately he got by a drunk driver and broke his neck, skull, spine and almost everything you can think of. When i visited him in the hospital after his crash it was one of the most painful things I have ever seen. Seeing my dad laying on his bed crying because he tried staying strong for us but could not keep it together. I had never felt so powerless. In the following months after the accident, we all had faith my dad would become the man he used to be. The man who always was the guy I could on. The man who was always supporting me on the sideline, but unfortunately the situation grew worse as he got diagnosed with a serieus brain injury. He had to accept he had lost it all. His work (he could not and still cannot), his sports (cycling, running, swimming and his dream of finishing an iron man ( one of the toughest sport races in the world)). With my mom working full time and my 2 brothers being away from home a lot he did not have a shoulder to cry on most of the time. While at the time we all had hope his brain injury would start to decrease, the only thing I can hope for now is that my family stays together. Because of my dad being home for most of the time and being in a mostly depressed state, he is sleeping a lot the time and draining the energy of all of the family members. While we all love him as much as we did before the accident, the suffering of both ends is coming to a point where the bubble will burst. The pain I am suffering is in no way compatible with the pain of losing your whole life. But losing your dad while your sitting right next to him hits you in a weird way. He cannot take much and gets extremely angry at my mom about the smallest things, while the only thing she deserves is love and appreciation. Right now I feel like I have lost the man who was on my side for the biggest part of my life. How I lost my dad",Depression

They would not have anyone to take care of them. that is what they would miss. And maybe they should. I have told them countless times how I feel. They do not care.

"Before I start, I promise I will show this and my other suicide notes to my therapist whenever I see them. I have been suffering from mental health illnesses for years (was diagnosed 6 years ago). I hate it. I genuinely hate it. I have to take meds to boost serotonin levels (store-bought serotonin as I call them). On my birthday in June, I told myself I will end things an year from then (provided things do not get better). I am 24 and am yet to do achieve anything significant (unlike my parents, siblings, close friends and connections on LinkedIn). Turning 24 recently is really hitting me hard. I graduated university at 21 and have done internships (a local bank, a Big 4 firm consulting firm and startups) every now and then. My last paid internship ended before the summer of 2020. I am yet to secure a full-time paid job since, unlike my peers who are pretty successful in the corporate world (i.e. they are getting promoted or moving to international offices say London, UK). But, then, there is me. I have wasted the last 3 years of my life. I could have learnt a new language. I could have learnt new software (say PowerBI). I could have been studying towards a professional qualification (say CFA, CAPM etc.). I could have lost weight and gained muscle. My ex left me at 21 because of me being suicidal and unstable back then. But, my untreated mental illnesses do not let me too. I messed up the final two years at university (relative to my first year performance which was stellar). At all of my internships, I was extremely slow with tasks i.e. making PPT slides, replying to emails (I believe I have undiagnosed psychomotor retardation). In my daily life, I avoid doing a lot of chores, for instance, doing the dishes, folding my laundry, cooking, reading a book. It takes me 30ish minutes to do the dishes (something that would take my sibling 15 minutes). It takes me 7 minutes to read a page of a novel. Taking that into account, it would take me 2 months to finish a 300 page novel. Because of how slow I am, I have gotten very dumb too (I struggle with basic mental maths and avoid doing things that require a lot of brain power). I am not even sure if therapy would help me. I am scared of entering the corporate world or pursuing a masters. Because of how slow and dumb I am and how stressed I get in pressured situations. I point fingers towards my untreated mental illnesses. At times, I wish I had cancer or something similar to show people around me that I was actually struggling. Even though, I told myself I will commit suicide a day after my birthday next year in June. If things do not get better (i.e. I do not land a full-time job and not be as slow as I am today). However, I feel like ending things this Saturday. My method of suicide would be jumping off a bridge (near a major public hospital) and getting hit by an incoming vehicle once I jump. Or, I will overdose on my meds. But, very likely, that will be next June. Whenever I hear of people dying on the news or from other sources, I say ""Lucky them. I wish it was me instead of them."" I always pray I die in my sleep. But, here, I fucking am. I know things will not get better (there is too many things to work on and fix). I am better off dying, either naturally or via suicide. I am currently working on launching a non-profit startup, centered around mental health. In that case, it will further motivate everyone involved in case I end up killing myself. Turning 24 has really hit me. It feels like I have run out of time to achieve things......it is too hard to turn things around. If you have made it this far, I appreciate you reading of my struggles and my suicidal thoughts. I have had enough (In tears as I type this)",Suicidal

"I had group therapy for the first time today. It sucked, I quit immediately. There are not any in person one on one therapists here. Not only that, I do not even really know what to do to get better. Or if I want to get better in the first place. My biggest problem, that I am Non-binary, is not even fixable. Outcast amongst outcasts, it is got to be the most hated minority since even other trans people hate on us. Not to mention other LGBT people and obviously everyone else. I read that like 87% of people would not even date a trans person, so I am assuming the numbers even higher for nonbinary people. Which makes everything very isolating. There is no way in the world I could even date in my current state, but even if I could I would never find anyone nearby. I thought the first step would be going to therapy, but that is over. I looked up the ones that take my insurance and there is like 4 in this area, 0 of which offer in person. And then even if we pretend everything else was solved, I still have no way to support myself. No way I can work because everything makes me want to kill myself, no way to go back to school because I am poor. No interests or passions at all besides making art.

"Currently 22. Life keeps getting progressively getting worse. Had pretty much everything going for me coming out of HS, lots of friends, a girlfriend who loved me, good family life, confidence etc. Things pretty much started to go down hill when I started college out of state. Gf broke up due to distance, she went to a different school. This pretty much sent me into a depression, have not gotten out of it. Did some of the right things, joined a fraternity, went out a good amount. Just never really developed a close group of friends at my new school, just kind acquaintances who came and went. Long story short developed a drug and alcohol problem and slowly but surely have become a loner. Most people I either got sick of my bs or just have moved on to their new lives now and most of my class has graduated. Have about 2-3 people I would consider friends, both at home and in school. Now I am a 22 year old sophomore.Troubles with the law and an accidental overdose in the past 2 years have just made things worse both mentally and in my day to day life. On probation, so going out to bars and socializing is pretty much out of the picture (I go to a party/sports school in a s town so that pretty much makes up 95% of the social life ) Been sober for 8 months and honestly just feel worse from when I had a drug problem. At least then I had confidence and the motivation to go out and at least make the effort to improve my life. Now I just sit in my apartment/room all day. do not have motivation to try and make new friends because of how many times I have failed at it and a lack of self esteem.

Not necessarily through suicide but by any means, like, freak accidents, accidental overdose, just anything that will end my life.

"I just had surgery for a potentially serious type of cancer. I have been in a good mood, except for the first week when I was told the diagnosis. I made the mistake of consulting Dr. Google and it sent me into anxiety.I had serious bouts of depression 30 years ago and a few bouts since then. Six hospitalizations, lots of med changes, stress, career disasters, relationship disasters, and substance abuse (alcohol).I have been sober for many decades, got to retire at 50, have no financial worries. Never got married and that one really bothers me some times. I was successful, high average attractive, sales for big corporations so had money. As a friend of mine likes to say, ""Women are not looking for guys like us"", (guys with morbid depression). God, I had a couple women in my mid twenties that were so gorgeous and smart as hell, but my behavior drove them off or I ditched them for a bottle.Anyways, I am in post recovery, have some post surgical aches and still waiting to hear pathology. I got sort of sad and moody this week. I think I will be in good shape, I was Stage II with something you do not want to go Stage III. Actually I could be III because the pathology is not back yet. I stopped doing things I like to do, painting, going out into the forests, fly fishing. I bought a new carbon fiber canoe a month ago, you can pick up with your pinky.

"Hey. I have a lot of stuff going on right now and I am really struggling. I just finished graduate school and got my masters degree. I should be thrilled but I am everything but.

I am so beyond proud but it scares me because I will not see her every day. I know they say call or FaceTime but it is not the same. My brother is actively trying to move out. I am the oldest sibling yet I still live at home. I cannot drive. I have so little work experience that no one wants to hire me. I feel pathetic, alone, lost, scared, depressed, worthless.

"I am a 17 yo guy and I have been struggling with depression, derealization and paranoia ever since I was 12. On top of that I now have GAD.I have been wanting to kill myself since I was 12 because at 12 yo I started having episodes of derealization caused by the paranoia that everything is a dream or fake.I have somewhat gotten over that, but all that has been replaced by depression and anxiety which caused me to fail 2 years of school. I hate myself for letting that happen.When school is on, every day I think of suicide and have really bad suicidal depressive mental breakdowns every night.Right now it is summer break, but I cannot take all that pressure again. Sadly, dropping out is not an option for me.I also hate myself because of my height. I am only 5'8/172cm tall and I live in a country where the male average height is 5'11/182cm. That makes me feel really inferior, weak and pathetic because most guys I know are taller than me.I think I feel bad about my height because I am secretly competitive so I have been feeling my whole life like growing taller is a competition.Just for the record, I am already in therapy and on antipsychotics and antidepressants.

"I have squandered most of my opportunities in life and i feel like a loser because I am. I was a high school athlete and I was a very social person growing up.

I was in Human resources last year and missed one course on my final semester so i never graduated. I hated the curriculum anyways... bunch of cucklord social justice bs...

I also used to experiment with a lot of mdma and smoke a ton of pot over 5 -10 years ago when i was first in University and I think that might have fucked me up as well. Life just sucks man...

"I have never attempted suicide but over the last few months my life has become so overwhelming that its now a constant thought. My grandfather committed suicide when my mom was 10 years old which affected me in two ways. 1) I actually understand how painful it is for the people you leave behind, that is why I said I have never attempted it even though I have thought about it many many times, and 2) everyone in my family believes its hereditary and gets overly concerned when I am in a mood. It makes it impossible to talk to anyone close to me about my own thoughts of suicide because I feel like they will take it almost too seriously. I know that does not make sense but I actually hate when people feel sorry for me. So I bottle up my depression and lash out at the people I love. In a perverse way I almost wish they all hated me so that it would make it easier to leave them. The logical part of my brain says my life will turn around and the depression will subside - that is just how life is. Its just incredibly painful right now. Before anyone suggests I go see a therapist or get on medication, I have seriously thought about it but unfortunately my depression is currently stemming from the fact that my business failed, I am in a black hole of debt and I cannot afford health insurance. Money troubles - it does not get more cliche than that. I do not care if anyone reads this or responds I just found it incredibly therapeutic to finally vent all of this. This subreddit helped just to see that my situation is not unique and were all humans dealing with our own circumstances. there is probably someone in our life that is going through their own version of hell and well never know about it and there is definitely at least one person in our lives that deeply cares about us whether we recognize it or not.

"I am currently in a living situation that is far from ideal and becoming unbearable. I need to move out, but I feel immense guilt and concern because of how much I am needed here. Ill start by explaining my relationship with my family. Older brother (X): My mom and I immigrated from Cuba when I was 4 years old. I am now 21. We had to leave X behind (we are 11 years apart), and he did not come to the US until I was 16. Because of the cost of communication and our extreme poverty throughout those years, X and I did not get to know each other at all. When he came, he felt like a stranger that I was expected to love because of our blood relation. From the ages of 16-21, he has engaged with my body in sexual manners without my consent (grabbing my ass, slapping my ass, getting on top of me, removing my clothing, forcefully entering the bathroom when I am showering, and looking at me naked, etc.). No one is aware of this except my therapist. I should mention that he is an alcoholic, and some of these instances occurred when he was under the influence. About 2 years ago he moved out with his girlfriend, but they recently broke up so he moved back home. I am now living with him again. Younger brother (Y): Y and I are also strangely enough 11 years apart but on the other end. He is such an impeccable human. He is my best friend. Watching him grow up has been the most fulfilling experience of my life. Unfortunately, the responsibility is too much. His dad passed away when he was young so it was only him, my mom, and I until 2016 when X moved to the US and joined us. My mom had to work a lot, and I was relied on to take care of my Y. This had an extreme effect on my education, extracurricular, social life, and mental health. I did not sign up to become a parent. Apart from financial support, Y relies on me for everything. My mom relies on me for everything. Mom: This is, of course, the most complex relationship I have. However, I will not go into as much detail. She treats me like a child, does not allow me to see friends, constantly making homophobic remarks (does not know I am gay), constantly offending my expression or lack thereof, does not support any of my decisions, forces me to shave armpits and legs because it is gross and is unladylike, cannot talk to her because everything turns into an argument.... the list truly never ends. - But she needs me to take care of Y, translate every document, upkeep the house, etc. I understand her pain and suffering. She has been through so much. And I know she truly does need me. This is why I am still here. I am needed. I am afraid of what will happen to them without me. But I am tired! Of being used, disrespected, neglected, uncomfortable, abused... I am so exhausted. I need to focus on my life. I need to prioritize myself- but I cannot. I am stuck. We are all currently living in a small 2 bedroom house. My mom is sleeping in the living room while Y and I share a room and X has his own. I am in college but because of the pandemic, I am staying here. I probably will be taking the upcoming semester off because its too difficult to do school here. A few weeks ago I was suicidal, and I almost did it, but I realized that the reason I wanted to kill myself was also the reason that I could not. I am in therapy for severe depression and learning how to socialize. I also experience derealization often. I do not know what I want to receive. I just needed to release. Thank you for listening.

"As the title says, I have been going bald for the past few years and it is made my life a living hell without a shred of hope. it is started when I was around 16.5-17 (24 now) and basically my life had stopped ever since. I need to mention I am using the common medications for hair loss, and though I have had nice results for some time, my hair is now at its worst state ever and it is only getting worse.I am so lonley, have no social life since I am ashamed to go outside, have never been loved by someone or even got intimate with a woman, and it is all because of this malicious curse. I would trade absolutely everything I have to have a normal head of hair, like a guy my age should have. I would give everything for the privilege of leaving my room without being ancious about my appearance. I know the hair is not my only problem, but it is most definitely the core of all the other ones.I was actually just at the hair transplant clinic as I am still trying to fight for my life, hopeful to make an appointment, and although the guy there said it is still too early for me (does not mean It looks anywhere near decent) he showed me my pictures from 5 years ago when I had last visited the clinic, and I looked so much better and had fantastic hair compared to what I have now. In fact, I was once a pretty handsome guy (though never appreciated it), but the combination of depression and baldness have made me look old, sad and ugly to a point of no return.In that point of time it really does not matter whether I actually end my life or not, because I feel like I am already dead. Actually, I do not even feel like I am human anymore, just a pathetic, useless piece of rubbish. Having ""better days"" is actually the worst thing, because getting back to life after them only makes me feel much worse.

"Hi, I do not know why I am writing this here or anywhere at all, but I feel like a mess and do not know what to do and pheraps someone here can help me.I cannot say I have ever struggled in life, I had everything I needed to this day, my parents always suported me even when I probablt disnt deserve it, I have a social life and friends even tho I am not very social, I feel like I have every thing One would need to live right. However I do not feel good about myself, have not felt since around 7 grade. Even tho I had everyting i could not bring myself to work towards a future. I never tried my best in school even tho I was fully aware that I needed to study in order to get a good job and live a confortable life, to make my parents proud and retribute the effort they put in to me. I ended up staying one more year in highschool finnishing a subject i failed and that marks one of my biggest lows, I saw my friends going to college having fun but most importantly going forward towards something, and there I was left behind with no purpose whatsoever. I started to feel depressed and started to stay late at night just thinking about life itself, purpose, value, right and wrong, it would call it an existencial crisis where i looked at myself not as me but as 1 in 7 billion, things I had as absolute such as concepts and values started to seem subjective and as time went on i came to face what I now know as nihilism. I started to stop sleeping in my bed because it seemed pointless, talking to people seemed meaningless to me, i resorted to procrastination in a whole nother level just so I would not have to think about living and life in general, the world to my eyes was if it had lost its color. And that when it hit me, why do I have to live like this? All this thoughts, lonelyness, zero purpose, crying nights, what reason do I have to stay? Suicide made its home in my head from there on but I still feared deaths, there were a few times where I grabed my fathers gun and just sat on the floor thinking, can I do this? What if this? What if that? I never could bring myself to do it and I always ended up cryng over how I cannot commit to anything even could not bring myself to end that cycle. After sometime i friend presented me a girl which would become my first girlfriend, the first person to this day to make me feel loved even tho how shity I felt I was. The relationship had a bad start since due to what was going in my head i could not bring myself to fully trust anyone and she was no exeption, everytime she went out to party I was overwhelemed with axiety and panic attacks, i could not contain it and had to talk with her to calm down which would always mess her night.

But it was not like that, today she left me 5 months ago because of my lack of my pupose in life, even tho my parents made the biggest effort I still have to make an extra year in college due to subjects i left due to my lack of effort and purpose. And now I feel slowly faling back into that hole, I even lost 15kg working out and trying to better myself but still i cannot seem to bring myself to ""live"" and still lack pupose. I try doing things but allways find some sort of escapism. Lately I have been feeling like a lost case, i suicide has been on my mind lately as well, i just do not know what to do, I still fear death and the worst part is that I had EVERYTHING and I messed up, i threw out every oportunity that is was given to me while there are other people strugling and still make an effort to move forward, i feel miserable, a failiure, and a waste of effort that was put on me. I am sorry for the long text and the bad english but I dknt want to worry my family and friends but still wanted to share what I felt for at least on time in my life, thank you for reading and if you are strugling please keep going, oportunities will arise but please take them, make it worth it do not be like me. I do not know what to do",Suicidal

"I have had anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember and from last year it is been really bad. Now this year is just pushing me over the edge. First my grandpa died then my dad got so sick he could have died and needed an emergency operation and he will need one more in a few months. Then my cat got really sick and she is still sick and I am trying so hard to get her better but I am failing. Then an animal at work that I have been really close to died while under my care. I have a partner but no friends and animals are my heart and soul. People generally repulse me. So, people might think that pet problems would not effect someone very much, but for me it totally stops my life and takes me over.The anxiety about my dad being OK is just on my mind constantly and the fact that the animal at work died under my care makes me feel so horrible and useless, I could not save him.. what the he will am I even there for then? And then my loving, lovely cat that I cannot help.. what the hell am I here for then? I wish she could just get better and I could get sick instead. I would give my life for her wellbeing if it was only possible to make the trade. I have not slept in 4 nights because I have been watching over her. And now awaits another sleepless night. And then tomorrow I have to go to work and it is killing me because ill have to leave my cat and I will not be able to watch her and I will just be a ball of anxiety while somehow working.My partner tries to be supportive but she does not really understand and when she jokes and smiles I just feel so alone.The only thing that keeps me from killing myself is how much it would hurt my parents and that I would fail my cat, she would not understand where her mommy went and then she would have to move and get a new mommy and I am responsible for her. But I am starting to feel like I am failing her anyways and someone else could be a better mommy to her and my parents are probably so tired of me and my constant nagging from worrying.Everytime I am driving I am thinking about finding a good brick wall to accelerate in to. I cannot take this any more. The constant sadness, hopelessness, worrying and fear This year has been hell and I just want to leave",Suicidal

I am not getting the proper help I can only see counsellor once a week and her advice for that was to find a psychologist that she would pay for once a month..... Last time I was in the hospital they said my CPTSD is critical and I need like the life saving help.So last week told my mom I need something more something impatient something where I can actually heal if you forgive me the right treatment. Her advice was basically stopped being a little bitch and just go back to the 24-hour hold.Then I called her 30 days ago and said I cannot fucking do this I am going to kill myself and I do not want to but I need like intense intervention right now or I am going to lose my fight.Her response was I do not know what to do but should I call the police on you......Now 2 days after which is now today, she calls me and leaves a voicemail cuz I was on the phone with two other lines already like one was I was on hold and the other one was actively like having a conversation. She send s this sulky guilt trippy fake I care about you I really need to know how you are doing' So I actually tried to call back because there is not maybe she wanted to finally help me. 6 hours later she finally picks up and says you know I have friends and people and places to be You do not need to be calling me all the time. And I said yeah like always there is always something before me. And then I told her I figured out the trip that she takes quite often is hours shorter than a drive to me.....

"The only things my mom can do is provide with the bare minimum which are food, shelter and etc. Other than that she is just terrible, and maybe sometimes she is nice when she is not screaming at me for nothing. I would say she is toxic because she always compares me to others including herself, she is a massive hypocrite who gets mad at me when I do the exact same thing as her, shr hit me as a child and also once when I was 12 byt that is a different story, she cursed at me as a child, she even fighted with her own mom and also with her dad for like half a year after we moved with him and even though she knows I have trouble with selfharm and that I am suicidal (because the psychiatrist had to tell her) she did not change a bit. Still yelling at me for little things and because of one of our daily fights I relapsed after I tried so hard to resist the urges. And I am writing this post right after one of our big fights where I *again* told her that she is not a good mom and that she is not self aware at all. In the end I told her that I did not want the psychiatrist to tell her because I do not trust her, I did not want to tell her that I think I have OCD because I do not trust her, I told her about my almost suicide attempt and that it was right after one of our massive fights, and after all that she says that there is still more life to live, so I am just done. I want to cut so bad right now but I do not want to use a knife again, I want to use a sharo blade but I cannot get one. She is also one of the people that thinks that a positive mindset will make everything better. Well mom, it is kind of hatd to get my grades up when I gave up on school and life.

Sometimes the loneliness gets so bad and I cry alone in my bed. Sometimes I wrap myself around a pillow and have to pretend it is someone, a boyfriend, for comfort. This is one of those times. Ik after this I will get up, brush myself off, and get on with my life, like I always do. I have to. But it would just be so nice to have someone hold me and whisper sweet nothings to me. To feel his warm embrace and his fingers play with my hair. To make me feel like I am worth protecting. Like I am important to at least someone. I am always fighting with myself internally. Ik that I should not have to depend on anyone for happiness. That I should be my own independent woman or whatever. And it is not like I am going to settle for someone who does not treat me right....and I know life is not all about love and relationships....but I just...I love feeling WANTED by somebody. Maybe that makes me needy and codependent but I just love it so much. I love being praised and spoiled with love. It hurts when I see other people living the life I want to live.

"Hey Reddit, sorry if this is too much but I really do not know where else to turn to so any advice at all would be helpful.One of my closest friends since I was 15 has been going through a lot recently, she is open about her feelings and what has happened to her and has always said she feels like her life is not worth living. We had not talked for a while since 2018 but she reached out last month and we have been hanging out a lot since then.However, she told me that at the beginning of this year she was sexually assaulted by an immediate family member and since then she has been traumatised and has developed PTSD. She told the rest of her family about this when it happened and wanted to press charges against him but they do not hear that as the perpetrator is under the age of 16, and I think this is the main reason as to her feeling this way as she told me she had always been quite close with her mother (who does not want her to press charges). Since then she has been living in a refuge as she cannot stand to be around her family, understandably, but it means that I cannot even try to call emergency services to come to her location as these places do not give out their address (even to the residents).She seems like she will go through with it as I found out she has been spending all of her money on her friends and buying people gifts, which sounds like her because she is an amazing person who has always been there for other people. And now it feels like no matter what I say or do, it is not enough and as someone who has thought the same things as her I understand that completely. She also told one of her friends that she has bought the 'equipment' to commit suicide and is planning on doing it next week (she did not specify which day as she does not want anyone stopping her) as she had tried to get through to her mother again earlier today about pressing charges but to no avail.I have spent a lot of time with her recently as it felt really good seeing her again and catching up after so many years, it is like she never left but she is about to. She reconnected me with one of my old buddies too, but since then told us that it was part of her 'bucket list.' I really do not know what to do I cannot even thin straight so I am trying to ask anyone I know for some advice, the situation she is in is a horrible one which I cannot even fathom so it feels wrong even trying to look for some way to help her as she is so insistent on what she is planning to do.If it helps with the advice, we live in the UK.

Due to covid I failed all my classes because I did not have any motivation and was severely depressed. I just want for it to all be over.It feels like nothing in my life is going well. Every time I am happy because I am with friends I zone out and think about all of the things stated above. I just cannot deal with this anymoresidenote: I am sorry if this is hard to read. English is not my first language and I am very bad at talking about how I feel .",Suicidal

"I am a bisexual man. But I do not want to be anymore. I am trying to not be open about my sexuality because I do not want to be viewed as a predator, deviant, degenerate, etc. I am scared of getting dirty looks or having slurs yelled at me for holding my boyfriend's hand in public.This just makes me hate myself even more than I already do. there is no place in society for someone like me.

This shit kicking my ass wtf,Depression
"I posted this in r/depression as well, but I figure this would be more appropriate. I always feel like I should not have any real reason to be depressed because I live in a first world country where there is an abudance of opportunity for anything you want. However, I have feelings of self-doubt, pity, anxiety and a general low self-esteem most of the time. I am 23 years old and I hate my life. I graduated in Mechanical Engineering in August 2020 and I still have not found a job in my field. This is partially the reason why my depression is bad. I have never had a girlfriend in my entire life and the last girl I tried to talk to ended up ghosting me. I do not particulary blame them either as it is my fault at the end of the day. I cannot beat the depression no matter how hard I try. I have followed every piece of advice I can take such as exercising, eating well, sleeping 8 hours a day, getting sunlight and I still feel like a piece of shit more and more.I would believe this might have to do with childhood-teenage trauma that I have had. My brother was not the best person in my life, which sucks becasue up to when I was 13 years old, he was amazing and awesome. Afterwards, he would because me a lot of physical abuse and mental abuse. He gave me two black eyes in school which many teachers would question if I was okay at home. I was not but I did not let them know that to protect my brother from receiving a bad reputation. I told my parents, but they did not really do anything about it besides a stern talking to my brother. He left me in -15 temperature one time for a few hours where I was just wandering the neighbourhood (I live fairly far from any store so I did not really have a shelter). The thing that makes it worse is that he has a successful life with a loving wife and amazing friends. It makes me sad that people can harm others and still never receive any karma.The next factor is the amount of bullying I received as a kid from my former friends. Surprisingly the ones who became my bully was my friend. This friend is very charismatic and good at getting friends himself. Due to my shyness and having virtually no backbone, I became a really easy target when we started highschool as he was able to convince other kids to bully me as well. The bullying was not anything crazy, just name-calling and making me look dumb a lot. However, they did this every day and it ended up taking a toll on me. These kids are also super successful now and have great relationships.I realized more in University how pathetic and below average I am to my peers. Everyone else can do things much more easier than I can, have much more talents, and are generally smarter than me. I have extreme social anxiety and I always struggle showing my persoanlity around others. Maybe it is a defense mechanism and I will be betrayed again. (Some Good Will Hunting type of shit lol) If it was not for TV shows and the internet, I would be a lot more depressed than I am now. I honestly believe I am a burden to everyone around me and my parents are making it more clear that they do not want me around since I have not obtained a job in my field and am sorta just coasting in life right now. Thank you for reading this post if you have, but if not I understand as well.TL;DR: I am killing myself in a month and I generally do not have any actualy reason to want to keep living Killing Myself Soon",Suicidal

"I have chronic health problems and pain, i have 2 bad phobias, i have anxiety and ocd symptoms, I am lonely, I am depressed, my mom is dying, I am suicidal.My anxiety and pain is crushing me. I am decaying, I am dying. I am losing the fight.My mom has a really serious illness and she can die any moment and probably will not live long anymore. She is the only person who cares about me, nobody else gives a fuck. She is also depressed and suicidal. She has threatened suicide but said that she is still alive just beacuse of me. She is the best mom ever.We live in the middle of nowhere and covid did not change anything. I have been living in this kind of isolation my whole life. And i have no friends, everyone thinks I am annoying. I am going to a different school now and i know absolutely no one. Its a big school and i was in a really small school. A huge change and facing it alone. I am so damn scared. I am probably going to get bullied beacuse of my appearence. If i get bullied.... I am going to kill myself. I am either anxious or in a neutral mood or i feel a strange mix of numbness and sadness. I cannot enjoy life. I am always thinking about this. I cannot cry even if i wanted.I have never actually got a full on anxiety attack but last night i took a knife and held it to my wrist. I did not do anything, i just sat there for a couple of minutes and then put away the knife. I knew that there was no way i could die, i would just had shredded my tendons and everything and fucked up my hand beacuse that is what usually happens when you slit your wrists. And i really like drawing and a lot of other stuff i need my hands for.As long as my mom lives, i live. If she dies, i die. I cannot live without her. I really cannot.Everytime i think about suicide i get really anxious and i want to cry but i once again cannot.Only thing that keeps me going is writing lyrics and poems and stuff.

"Ever since the UK had a large country lockdown thing last year, my social life has gotten worse and sometimes I cannot even speak as I do not know what to say.Recently, I have been getting more persistent suicidal thoughts and wanting to self harm. Thankfully, my addiction to the internet has basically saved my life as I have found out what phobias are. Me having a phobia of death and pain really saves me from doing anything to hurt myself. Though, at times I get SERIOUS thoughts, but I try and consider the good things in life and turn to them for help.Another problem is that me and my parents have completely different views on mental health. I think it is looked down upon to be ""mentally unstable"" and it should be talked about more, my mum is a nurse who thinks she knows everything but she most certainly does not, and lastly (the worst of all) my dad. He tells me that I should not cry because its annoying, anxiety is a stupid thing and it is all just a phase, that I am not depressed I am just being a teenager. Speaking of what he says, I am scared of him because he would shout at me all the time when I was little (sometimes It was justified, most of the time it was not) and he tells me that I should be scared - he just does not understand that children are not supposed to be scared of their dads.Sorry this is long but, NEXT. Unfortunately on the subject of suicide, I have attempted to commit suicide. It was a couple months ago when I was in the bath. I was listening to some what I call ""Lucid Dreaming"" sort of music and my family was downstairs watching the TV and nobody had checked on me in a while. Since my mum is always worrying because she knows I struggle with self harm thoughts, I was wondering why she is not shouting up to me asking if I am okay.

"I am the only sibling who struggles a lot with mental health, from what I know of. My sister has had her moments, but she is never been constantly struggling, and my brother is always positive. But, I am the one who is depressed. I am the one who is anxious. I am the one who cannot make friends because it pains me to talk to people. I am the one who barely does anything but sit in my room and write and read. My parents have done a lot for me, they always try to help with my mental health, even if they do not understand it, but I wonder sometimes if they are embarrassed of me. I wonder if my sister or my brother is embarrassed of me. I wonder if they all get tried of me asking about small, stupid things because I am terrified about them. I wonder if they get tried of me looking so sad all the time or barely hanging out with anybody. I wonder if when someone asks about me, my parents do not talk about me because who would want to talk about a depressed kid? Anytime I try to speak up and ask for some comfort on something, I feel like my parents are just tired of me. Over the past year, I have been getting better at being able to speak up when worried, but it seems as if they are irritated and upset with me for asking for comfort so much over such stupid things. In my head, they are big and suffering and keep me up at night, but my parents always tell me that I cannot let those kind of things control me. I am trying. I am really trying. But sometimes I just need someone to tell me it is going to be okay, you know? I am worried they all think of me as an embarrassment. I am worried they are getting tired of my questions and my worries. I am just worried that being like this makes me embarrassing. Am I something to be ashamed of? Should I be ashamed?

Its just miserable and I feel exhausted and like a burden. I am tired of waiting for things to get better. I know I have a lot to be grateful for and there have been some good memories but I have had enough. there is been more despair and pain than moments of happiness.

"Hi, I am early 20s (M) in Scotland and I have been really struggling with my mental health from loneliness and isolation. This is just perhaps a desperate lost call for guidance haha if anyone out here can relate/empathiseBasically I have had a really tough few years. I was out of a extremely tough relationship just before covid which I have found unbelievably difficult and then combined with all the isolation a year on from covid, I have really been experiencing a huge amount of sadness/depression and loneliness consequently, which has also extremely affected and shaken my self esteem quite a bit and I have lost a lot of confidence and easily get a lot of self-doubt about myself. The relationship was quite one-way I had to put a lot of love in and I was not getting anything back, I feel dumb for hanging on to it for years trying to cling some kind of hope. There have been other stressors as well but this seems to be the worst contributor to my sadnessIt's been a really hard time and I have been trying so hard to get out of it but it can be extremely rough sometimes. I have been paying for expensive private professional help/counselling recently that i self-referred myself to try console me through it but I think at the end of the day I really crave some new social contact and try get my confidence back again. I do not really know what my hobbies are either outside of being outdoors(vague i know) and coding which is not the most sociable thing ever lol. I have tried dating apps for weeks and to very little success. I do not know the best way to meet new people these days? in Scotland?

I feel like noone can tell me how to to fix it or that things will improve, which makes me feel more hopeless.

"I have been having suicidal ideation nearly every day for the past few years and the older I get, the worse it gets. At this point killing myself feels inevitable. I am taking a break from school and my student loans will be due soon which has been making me feel like I have to just do it. My parents took out tens of thousands in parent loans as well and considering I do not have a degree or a well paying job there is no way I could possibly help to pay it back. And how could I ask them to pay for that when they already are only just scraping by? Killing myself has always felt like the way things will end for me as I have a lot of trouble connecting with people and I really do not want to be alone for another fifty plus years. That being said, it has always felt far away. So now with my student loans looming I feel like its probably coming to be time and its freaking me out a bit to be honest. I have no one to discuss this with (my mom yelled at me when I had tried to discuss this with her a few years ago) so I just needed to write this and put it somewhere. Sorry if I have broken any rules of this sub I have never been here before. feels inevitable at this point",Suicidal
"I have been depressed for as long as i can remember. since i was really young, i have run away into fantasy worlds to escape my current reality. 99% of my problems stem from my family, and how little my parents care about my mental well being. they do not even think the concept of mental health exists. they relentlessly made fun of simone biles recently for dropping out of the olympic competition due to stress. i cannot tell my parents about anything I am going through, and even when i do they dismiss it. i do not feel like trauma dumping on a friend i love and trust. recently things have gotten bad again and i just cannot look forward to anything. i have started to hate the sport i loved for the majority of my life, i have become withdrawn from my friends, i do not have any expectations for the future. the only thing that anyone sees is a high achieving girl that seems to do it all. I am not smart. the only thing I am good at is disappointing my parents. the only thing I have ever wanted is to make them proud but i will never do that. what is even the point of being alive if i cannot make my own family proud of me? i wish i had never been born and i could have saved my parents from all that they have to do for me. i will never give them anything but sorrow and disappointment and resentment. i should just go drown myself like my dad says when you do not look forward to most things",Depression

"Main problems are sharp pains in liver throughout the day constant loss of consciousness for two days after my overdose and my breathing has been a bit more laboured, also wrenching a bit and feeling a bit sick. I am most concerned about the liver pains as they are consistent and actually make me say ouch occasionally and I have a high pain threshold. My liver just does not feel right after this. It was a busy night when I did what I did and I did not feel like a pain to the nurses but probably was to the doctor who could not understand why I was not immediately reacting the way he wanted me to. Well I actually did I just seemed to have a delayed reaction to the drugs I took for whatever reason. I am worried about my liver. I took a pretty high dosage and I do not understand why it took a day to react. Just a couple hours before I was meant to be leaving hospital I started to strongly react to the medication I took. I had all the symptoms. Then I spent the two days immediately after taking the overdose getting all of the worst symptoms. A bit while hospitalised and mostly not. The medication was out of date and there for if i ever needed to kill myself. I would have been smarter doing this a different way because now I have no idea what I have done? Sometimes I do not care then I get a sharp pain in my liver and do not like the idea of dying slowly of cirrhosis. I suppose most people who want to die would rather just take a painless route but those are basically unavailable unless you really know what you are doing. I am having pains after overdose I was hospitalised for a few days ago.",Suicidal

"I have been experiencing an increasingly hellish hell for many years and I am closely nearing the end of what I have the strength to bear. I have money saved to purchase a few acres of land in another state, but my depression, anxiety, and confusion of navigating the adult world has thus far hindered me in making this long-held dream a reality. Too scared of making a mistake, scared of risk and change, even if it is change for the better, something I know I want deep down. So to stimulate motivation, I have made a pact of life and death with myself; if I fail to aquire a new home by the latest deadline of this upcoming December 31st, I will take my own life by opiate overdose in a motel room on January 5th of next year, probably sometime in the evening. It does not help that I want to die anyway. A death pact is hardly a motivator when you are already suicidal. It seems like ending my own existence would be easier and a more certain win than anything else I have ever done as it seems as though my hopes and dreams are nothing but shattered shards of failure and regret. I want to see beauty in life, a reason to keep living, but darkness is blotting it all out now. I hope things change soon. They have to or I am going to die.

Its weird because during the course of it I felt pity, I felt scared, I felt sorry but mostly ashamed and guilty I still think I could have avoid all of this. I do not have any energy left on me. I used to be a huge player and the fact that I was reminded and worse constantly manipulated and tested and lied to did not help me a lot, yet I still feel this emptiness. Again.

"Hi, hoping this will make me feel better. This summer has been hard. I am medicated for anxiety/depression, have a partner I love and that is so supportive, a dog that means everything to me and a safe place to live but it still feels impossible to be happy most days. I work as an RDH and that has taken a toll, especially since COVID- its exhausting. I like the perspective my job gives me, I have a great boss and coworkers but having to always be on for patients is SO draining when I feel like shit myself. Its important to me to be an empathetic provider/provide positive experiences so that is probably the hardest part. I get a lot of nervous, anxious / patients in pain and I feel like a sponge- all that gets soaked up. I wish I lived somewhere else so I felt like I am not here to pay off debt until I die. Parents are retiring soon and I just think welp, that will never be me. cannot afford good enough medical insurance to get quality care, nothing is/has ever been worth the copay. I used to want to have kids to give them the ~happy childhood~ I did not have but why add another burden to the planet. The future is not sustainable. Country is legit on fire, nature is dying.

"I have been reflecting on my life a lot lately, and I always find myself going back and thinking about the bullying I have dealt with through my life. Hopefully sharing my story here can get some outside perspectives and give me an idea on how to move on.So a little about myself, I am a introverted guy whose hobbies fall in Video Games, anime and music. I have been playing video games since I was 3 and they have been my major escape for most of my life. I grew up in a small rural town for most of my life (From when I was born to my senior year, am currently 25) and was actually a pretty optimistic kid in my youth, free-spirited and just looking to have fun and make people smile. My parents have been pretty decent, but they were never around to support me so I mostly just stayed in my room playing games. It was around the age of 4 the I first experienced any sort of bullying. A couple of my older cousins would pick on me for some of the games I played. (I was a PlayStation kid growing and they were Nintendo kids and around 8-9 at the time this was happening) Unfortunately nobody really stepped in to stop them but things never went beyond verbal insults.This went on till I was about 8-9 myself and they grew up enough to stop it and we get along on the rare occasions I see them. Elementary school was pretty uneventful as I mostly just kept to myself. Middle school was where things took a turn for the worse.In my 5th grade gym class we had to start changing into gym clothes and I never got the memo that boxers were even a thing and was still wearing briefs at this point. We were all getting changed and I realized what was up, got really nervous because I noticed everyone else was wearing clothes that I did not even know existed and went into the one stall in the locker room to change, needless to say the locker room was full of boys making fun of the fact that I was wearing briefs. It was at this point most of the male classmates in my class and the grade above me started just verbally making fun of me, and the female students would either just do nothing or tell me to not make eye contact with them.By the time I got to my 6th grade, I only had a few friends and most of them were not actually friends with me and ended doing some things to me. I was getting no support from family or teachers and was started to feel isolated, so I tried to fake being cool, which did not really do anything in the long run. It was also this year where I saw another student in my grade wearing sweat pants to school, and since I had some figured I could wear some. I remember walking into class and a few classmates giggled a bit amongst themselves. I went to use the bathroom at some point in the day and on my way back was stopped by a female bully, who proceeded to call me gay and saying wearing sweat pants is ""for girls"" and other verbal insults. This was the only time I ever cried in school for something like this.I feel like I had to grow up really quickly emotionally in school due to a mixture of all this bullying and teachers would also make me hang out with special needs students, even if I did not want to. In 7th grade I had a crush on another girl in my class (She was one of the only people in my class, let alone the school that actually treated me like an equal person) and some of my ""friends"" physically dragged me over to her after I let them know that I had a crush on her and made me grope her breast, all the while I was begging them not to. (Thankfully she did not hate me for this)8th grade was the first time I can remember wanting to die, not exactly wanting to commit suicide but wishing I could just cease to exist. I started to become really jaded, I could not trust anyone save for a few friends that I barely saw because I was too busy still trying to live this ""cool"" facade externally but just feeling so angry inside. Being exposed to all these people hating and belittling me made me start loathing myself too. Near the end of the year, the same group of ""friends"" from earlier pressured me into smoking some cigarettes that they managed to find. (I do not even remember where) I took one whiff, and in the back of my head I just said ""that is it, I am done with these guys, this is not what I want to be""I left that school with one friend that I had just made that year, social anxiety and self-hatred from all the harassment. I remember that summer feeling really lonely, like I was just existing but I lost a lot of my drive and happiness.High school was better at least, there was still bullying, nothing compared to my old school but I think some people could sense my insecurities and would pressure me into saying or doing things, I tried to own this ""one man wolf pack"" loner sort of shtick but deep down I just wanted to be accepted. Things ended completely by Junior year but by that point the damage was done.Nowadays I have a small group of friends who seem to like me for who I am. I still deal with the insecurities and fears from all those years ago and feel really emotionally stunted, like there is still this scared kid trapped in the body of this cold, logical body.For those who took the time, thank you so much for reading all of this, any advice on what I can do to move past my fears and insecurities are appreciated. Hopefully I did not come off as too whiny. Looking to share my story of being bullied.",Depression

I genuinely do not get why i need to live, i do not want help i want to die",Suicidal

His problem that he has no conviction, little prick.I honestly do not have the energy to fight my brain and my parents at the same time.

I will not have to deal with this shit anymore, because its not worth it, and I can go out having some fun at least. I am giving up on trying to get better.

"Apologies in advance if this post does not totally make sense, I am feeling emotional and I am also a bit high...I have been feeling extra suicidal for the past couple weeks, have a history of attempts, and I think sometimes when the suicidal feelings are this strong they stay strong until I 'do' something about them, i.e. try to off myself. And today I have been seriously considering doing it again, and am honestly trying to talk myself into it because the logistics are right (dog would be taken care of) and I had a therapy session today that basically seemed to confirm for me that things are hopeless and are not going to change any time soon. But, ambivalence.So...my dilemma is that if I am rational enough to think that I should maybe take myself to the psychiatric hospital ER, then presumably that is me deciding not to kill myself, so then why am I even at the ER? But if I do not take myself there, it is like suicide is still on the table and it is a 'should I or should not I' kind of torture until the point when these feelings get a little less strong (which is not necessarily any time soon, based on recent history) or I am upset enough to stop thinking rationally and try something impulsive. And I know I would just fail again. And I cannot deal with more of that flavour of shame.I know asking for advice on the internet for a topic like this is not ideal, so I am not asking whether you think I should go to the hospital or not, but maybe share what you have done if you have found yourself in a similar situation? I usually do not find helplines helpful and it is been a while since I went to ER and I am just not sure if this is one of those times when it makes sense to go. I do not want to feel like a moron telling them I am there because I do not want to kill myself, and be stuck there for hours when it is not like they are going to be able to help improve anything short term. I already see a psychiatrist every other week so it is not like I need them to connect me with that resource. But going it alone when I am at this point can be scary and feels really painful and is probably kind of stupid sometimes. &amp;#x200B;TL;DR when you have felt really suicidal but rational enough to realize you should do something to prevent yourself from acting on it, what did you do? How did it work out? Need thoughts on going to the ER or not",Suicidal

I can find none of this precious info I skimmed through so long ago I know things have changed a lot and the removal of all of these sites, posts and resources is for everyone is safety but I feel so frustrated, I am at a dead end.

"This is my first post ever talking about my depression, idk where to start. This past week I have been sick with a minor cold and while being sick it made me realize how much of a loser I am in life. I am currently unemployed and stressed about going back to community college knowing I lost my financial aid privilege from being a careless idiot in the past. My mom has spoiled me too much growing up and I took it for granted. It really hurts me to know I have not accomplished anything in life yet just to put a smile on her face. I had a job back in early May where I working a Physical Therapy Aide position but did not even last a month there. I thought I was doing fine until I got a phone call to not come into work anymore. I cannot even hold down a job ffs. No one in my family knows I got fired yet, too embarrassed to tell them. I do not think I have lasted at any job for more than a year. I have been applying to a few places, but no responses. I think I was meant to be a loser in life. Today was the first day I broke down completely in a long time when I came into a realization that I have pretty much 0 growth since I graduated high school back in 2017. Since middle school, I always had low self-esteem. I never tried to man up. I was lucky enough to be in a 5-year relationship w my high school love. My low self-esteem issues were the reason we went our separate ways when I would always decline invitations to do activities with other people. it is weird bc I do weight training at the gym every week since I was 17, and you would think that would build complete confidence, but the self-esteem issues are still there. I wake up late everyday in my same depressing room, open up my laptop and watch useless youtube videos, gym, come back home and do the same thing. I really have nobody to text or socialize with besides my sister. I would say my older sister is my only friend at the moment. She graduated from college a few years ago and works a job related to her career. She always gives me advice, but I would brush it off bc I am too pussy to completely open up to her. I am going crazy. The day is almost over and what did i even do today? I am a little kid in a young adult's body 22-year old in deep depression. Now starting to go crazy",Depression

"As of lately it feels like my life has been so stagnant and I have never felt so alone. I am currently studying a career but I do not even know if I truly love it.. just a interest I picked up.

I thought I did and it felt great and I was motivated but now its whatever. I have no family, I mean I do but we are not bonded together and I do not feel comfort and constant connection like its symbiotic. I have not had any friends for over 2 years, just meet and greets here and there. My father passed away when I was 3 and I truly believe he was the only person that was outgoing and engaging and would have never let me feel alone. I mean I have invested in certain things but its not enough. what I want is adventure and for everyone in bad situations to be free as well. where the fuck is the unity in todays world? we are all one race and it does not feel like it. its to yourself work, make money be selfish and that is it.

I got up and came back to my condo where I am now just bawling my eyes out. Like I am not gay, but if it was is that an insult like I am so confused.

I did not find out about that until three weeks after I had to pay for the abortion.

"Today was the first time I really thought about suicide. I have often thought through my life about death and imagined dying and have said things like ""i wish I was not alive"" to myself multiple times a day and have so for many years. But this was sort of a coping mechanism I think to deal with stress. I have been pretty successful in life, and probably happy by a lot of people's standards. In general i have been pretty driven and interested. I was clinically depressed about 15 years ago, but I have not had a similar episode since.However, today I felt a really different feeling when my usual thought came for the day. I did not just think ""I do not want to be alive"", I thought ""maybe I will not be soon"". I thought of some familiar fantasy of dying, but this this time it was real life. I thought about how I could enact that fantasy. Then I wondered if that was really a realistic way to die. I do not want to die painfully. And I do not want to be resusitated and disabled by damage afterwards. So I spent the day researching suicide method outcomes and considering how nasty or available each one would be, all while pushing my two kids on the swings at the park and buying them some chocolate, making dinner, talking to my spouse, putting the kids to bed.I just cannot describe how strange it feels for these fantasies to have moved from this thing I did to cope with how stressed I was feeling to this other, ""oh I can do this"" feeling. It was so unexpected. It was just a normal day.I have never had these thoughts before, and I just wanted to write it down somewhere. I found this subreddit in the course of the day, and I have reddit so I thought it would be as good a place as any.

"Untill now I was the so called ""good guy"". Always trying to be pleasant around others, always trying to help, always saying ""thank you"" and ""you are welcome"" when needed etc. Recently I decided to adopt and raise a cat. But there is something very dark that came to the surface which I did not know that existed, and I have the very hard to resist temptation to hurt my cat, watch her squeal in fear as I am being a total piece of shit to her. First few weeks were great. I may have been rough to her sometimes during those weeks but it was nothing too serious. We were always sleeping together, playing together and we were practically inseparable. She was happy, and I was happy too.But once I decided to return to the house I grew up in, where some childhood trauma events have occurred, it was like a switch flipped, and I became a monster. I became very abusive towards my cat, and I have a very hard time stopping. Now I try to keep her outside my room and encourage her to hide because there is a monster inside me, which I cannot control.And because of that, I feel like I do not deserve anyone in my life. I was being a hypocrite all along, pulling of an act, and I deserve to be alone. Hell, I feel so guilty that I want to outright die, because I cannot live with the guilt and shame because of this.I know there will be people who will hate me for what I said.

"I figured I would rant in a depression sub more than anywhere else. I always feel like I should not have any real reason to be depressed because I live in a first world country where there is an abudance of opportunity for anything you want. However, I have feelings of self-doubt, pity, anxiety and a general low self-esteem most of the time. I am 23 years old and I hate my life. I graduated in Mechanical Engineering in August 2020 and I still have not found a job in my field. This is partially the reason why my depression is bad. I have never had a girlfriend in my entire life and the last girl I tried to talk to ended up ghosting me. I do not particulary blame them either as it is my fault at the end of the day. I cannot beat the depression no matter how hard I try. I have followed every piece of advice I can take such as exercising, eating well, sleeping 8 hours a day, getting sunlight and I still feel like a piece of shit more and more. I would believe this might have to do with childhood-teenage trauma that I have had. My brother was not the best person in my life, which sucks becasue up to when I was 13 years old, he was amazing and awesome. Afterwards, he would because me a lot of physical abuse and mental abuse. He gave me two black eyes in school which many teachers would question if I was okay at home. I was not but I did not let them know that to protect my brother from receiving a bad reputation. I told my parents, but they did not really do anything about it besides a stern talking to my brother. He left me in -15 temperature one time for a few hours where I was just wandering the neighbourhood (I live fairly far from any store so I did not really have a shelter). The thing that makes it worse is that he has a successful life with a loving wife and amazing friends. It makes me sad that people can harm others and still never receive any karma. The next factor is the amount of bullying I received as a kid from my former friends. Surprisingly the ones who became my bully was my friend. This friend is very charismatic and good at getting friends himself. Due to my shyness and having virtually no backbone, I became a really easy target when we started highschool as he was able to convince other kids to bully me as well. The bullying was not anything crazy, just name-calling and making me look dumb a lot. However, they did this every day and it ended up taking a toll on me. These kids are also super successful now and have great relationships. I realized more in University how pathetic and below average I am to my peers. Everyone else can do things much more easier than I can, have much more talents, and are generally smarter than me. I have extreme social anxiety and I always struggle showing my persoanlity around others. Maybe it is a defense mechanism and I will be betrayed again. (Some Good Will Hunting type of shit lol) If it was not for TV shows and the internet, I would be a lot more depressed than I am now. I honestly believe I am a burden to everyone around me and my parents are making it more clear that they do not want me around since I have not obtained a job in my field and am sorta just coasting in life right now.

"I never thought it is possible, but I have a case of mental illness, that is practicaly incurable. it is based on ""only"" severe emotional neglect through childhood (and adulthood) but when it is mixed up with too much responsibility from early age, it becomes incurable.I will explain. Normally in therapy patients are taught to find their inner child and nurture it the way patients have not been nurtured. This gives the restless inner child fixing experiences and after few years of inner child work, mental health gets better. But if you are neglected AND you had to take care of yourself, taking care of your inner child is just playing the trauma again, so it is not healing. It is only retraumatizing.And this mixture means constant panic-like feelings, like what a baby would feel when left on the side of the road. Panic, fear, chaos, eventually deathwish. These feelings might be on the surface or hide in dark, but they are never absent. Therefore I do not sleep. I do not enjoy. I do not connect. I do not love. There is no hope of feeling nurtured or satisfied unless someone else does the parentification. And since I am not adoptable minor, that means never. So do you know any cults with charismatic father-figures? Can be a suicide cult. Incurable mental pain",Suicidal

"I (17M) have been diagnosed with Aspergers, although my experiences are better described as high functioning autism (although I do not function at all lol), a semi-official type of Autism. Luckily, my autism was recognised very early in my life, when I was about 3/4 years old. I was diagnosed with PDD-NOS (later with Aspergers). Because of my amazing parents who fought very hard for me to get the help I needed, I got special training in primary school. I not only learned how to communicate with other people, but also to control my ""explosions"", when it all got too much for me from all the information in my head I exploded (screaming, swearing, slamming with doors). I am very thankful for this and it has allowed me to be socially semi-functional and make friends. However, this training had an unintended consequence, I was convinced that the only way to be accepted in society was to isolate myself when it all got too much for me. This does not always work out, and afterwards I feel really guilty, especially if it happens around people I love, because I see it leaves an impact on them. It also does not really help that I am constantly irritated, because of the pandemic, lack of sleep and maybe depression?I feel so guilty for being such an asshole, my friends and family do not deserve it, it is also the reason I feel like I do not deserve their love. Does anyone have similar experiences and/or advice how to convince myself I am worthy of love? I would really love to hear your thoughts I feel like I do not deserve love",Depression
"NSFWI have been depressed since a child. I watched my grandfather die at age 4 of a heart attack in front of me, I was sexually assaulted by my neighbors and age 7 my bio dad passed away. When I was 12 one of my friends committed suicide by hanging himself in his home. I lost my paternal grandma age 18, my maternal grandma age 20 and step grandma age 21 all whom I was extremely close with. I lost my uncle a few weeks before Christmas due to a heart attack just after losing my paternal grandmother right before Thanksgiving.In 2015 my cousin was murdered (shot in the back of the head) in 2018 my paternal grandfather to a heart attack and we had to pull the plug, he died on my fathers birthday 6 February which is 6 days before my birthday. Also, in June 2018 I lost my younger brother due to a devastating car accident that left his body mangled and we found this out the day after it happened, right after my other grandfathers funeral. My brother did not have his ID on him so they could not identify him immediately.2020 I lost my aunt due to a heart attack two days after Thanksgiving. 14 January 21 I lost my mother after her battled with Covid-19. Due to having small children, one with severe respiratory issues and the pandemic I had not seen my mother. The last time I saw her alive was in early December at my aunts funeral. That was the last time I hugged her and held her hand.Forward to March and I lost another aunt, she lost her battle with leukemia.there is more death and many other reasons but my main trigger has been death/loss. I have cried because I am tired of living and want to end my life. I get angry that I have kids because I am afraid of what my loss will do to them and my wife. Especially, after already losing a brother and recently losing two aunts and our mother, I am afraid of what would happen to my brothers if I kill myself.But, the desire is increasing everyday. I am miserable, in a miserable marriage with a wife that does not get me and cares solely that her needs (physical touch) are not being met.I am just ready to leave life behind!

"I like to think that I am a proactive person. I believe that if you have unexplored options, you do not have a right to complain. But this is the second time in my life where I feel like I have absolutely no options left. I tried so many ways to be happy and to survive in the past year and they all failed spectacularly or simply evaporated. The crazy thing is that it is not even my fault, I did everything I could. Its the pandemic, it is the economy, it is our slow-ass indecisive bureaucracies, it is everyone being sad at the exact same time.I am talking to a military recruiter soon because I feel like it is my only option left in order to have any level of economic security. But everything else failed, so what is keeping this from not working out too? I have already come really close to killing myself in the past month and a half. I do not want to feel trapped, I do not want to feel like I do not have any options just to simply live. When you feel trapped, you are always one step away. I do not want to be there.

I do not even know how I got it, or if I am the one who infected them, but I just do not care at this point.I was doing so well. I was spending time with my friends and family (outdoors, with masks when needed). I had a workout routine and was feeling so confident in myself. I was going to therapy every week.

I cannot do weightlifting and my body dysmorphia is back full force. I cannot be around my loved ones. I cannot go to therapy.

"So this is my first time posting on Reddit, apologies if I mess up. To make a long story short, I failed my first year of college. My parents are okay people. they have done some bad stuff to me in the past, but I know they love me so I try to not put it against them. So my dad took out a loan to help me pay for college. Thing is, after COVID restrictions, my mental health went down, way down. I was hardly showing up to my online classes, hardly doing assignments. I failed most of my classes both semesters. I am still enrolled in my school by a gracious loophole the school provides, but I did lose my financial aid for next year and my parents do not know any of this. They are going to pay off the loan today, and its killing me inside. I do not know if they will find out I failed this year or not, but either way I feel that I am such a horrible child, even if I cannot help my mental illness I could have reached out. I do not even want to go to college anymore. I do not want my parents to dump so much money on my stupid suicidal ass, I want to die so they do not have to pay off my loans. I cannot go on, I feel like a walking failure for not just doing my work. Why did not I do it? what is wrong with me? I hate myself so much, why cannot I just be a good child to my parents? I cannot do anything right so I feel like the only way to repent is to die any advice is appreciated I am such a horrible child",Suicidal

"Sorry in advance if some sentences do not make any sense as I am not a native speaker. Most of my english comes from memes and series. I am 25 years old male, big loser with no education and living in a shit hole. I have been depressed since I have been concious, and the pain has been gradually increasing to a point that I feel like I cannot take it anymore. My father was not present when I was a kid, and because my mom had to take care of me alone, she overworked herself so she could sustain her kid. The absence of my father and mother in my life hurted me a lot, and while I despise my father for leaving my mom when she was pregnant, I can totally understand why she was absent and trying to give me a decent life to her best efforts. I was physically abused by my babysitter on a daily basis. It was very hard for me to articulate to my mom what she was doing, and this ended when a friend of my family witnessed what she was doing to me one day. After that, I started living alone in our house because my mom could not trust anyone else to take care of me (this was when I was 9 yo). At my 11 years of age, I was sexually abuse by a woman that was 4 years older than me. The experience was very traumatic and sex has always been very difficult since then. All of my romantic relationships have ended in abandonment from my partner, and I wonder if the sexual abuse that I suffered earlier has to do with that. I deserted my undergrad (Mechatronics) because I was scared of failing again in life, and running always seemed easier and safer (I deeply regret this now that I am older, but it is too late to go back). Now I am stuck in a third world country with a very high crime rate and extreme poverty, with no education, no good jobs prospects, nothing. I was very close to end my life a few days ago, but my current girlfriend decided to call me randomly and I broke down into tears and told her everything, and she convinced me to not do it. I have never tried suicide before, but that day I was completely commited to end my life violently and for good. My current relationship is long distance. she is in another country, with an ok job and is on her way to become a permanent resident. Because of my lack of education and preparation, it is almost impossible for me to go to where she is. We met when we were younger in the current country that I live in, and we had a relationship but she left me for reasons that I did not know back then, and then we reconnected few months ago and we are together again (yea, I know that this was a very bad decision). I have decided that I am going to ilegally inmigrate to a first world country and gamble my life there. My options are limited and I fucking hate life so why not? This was a decision I made before I got into this relationship, but now that I am compromised with someone, and realised that there is no way in hell we could be together because she would have to leave everything just to live together with a good for nothing. It really sounds ridiculous. She says that she is deeply in love with me, and would do anything to be together. I feel like what is going to happen is that she is going to realise that she had to sacrifice a lot for an unknown future with someone that is a loser and will end up hating me. I also deeply love her, and I do not think I could forgive myself ever. I want to end my life. I do not think I can fix my situation, and even so, the temptation of killing myself will ever go away. I am so sorry for my mother that had a very rough life, and it seems that I am about to just make it more miserable for her. I hope that my mother, girlfriend and friends could forgive me, but maybe that is asking for too much. I definitely do not deserve any of that. Thank you for reading my story. Am at my wits' end.

"I am 19 and I feel like I have wasted the best years of my life. When I was younger I was extremely shy and scared of everything. I was scared of talking to people at my school, and talking to girls. Even though I was not ugly or something. When I went to highschool I did not really enjoy going to partys with people I did not know so I partied with my closest friends. Now when I have finished highschool I know that I wasted that time. I wish I was more outgoing, not so shy and did not spend so much time at home. I know that there is a lot of younger people here. So I want you to stop worrying and enjoy this time. Ask her/him out, you have got nothing to lose. you will get rejected? So what? Stop dreaming about things that can happen and actually do something to make them happen. I wish I asked Eve out, I did not do it but I knew that she was into me. Maybe I was wrong? I would get rejected? I do not care. Start living and maybe one day you will not feel like me.

You have no time to cook a healthy meal because you come home at night and you are so exhausted from the day.

"*^(\*(this got deleted from the self-harm section so I am reposting here)\*)*self-harm has been a struggle for me for a while now.the other night i had a very bad episode (intense panic, I have been struggling with depression and severe anxiety for a while now). so i grabbed my blade, went to the bathroom, and wanted to end it all. i went very very deep on my arms (vertically). my dad saw my arms and grabbed the blade away from me, my mom tried to help &amp; i was taken to the hospital where i got stitches.these past 2 days, a number of people in my life have found out about the incident 2 nights ago. let me tell you, not one of them has reached out to ask if i was okay or tell me they were glad i was still here. they are just so ..... nonchalant about it.its basically confirming the fears I have had for years now -- that, if i actually went through with my urges &amp; committed suicide, no one would care. i mean their behavior is pretty much proving it. my own siblings and parents have not said a word about it. just ""stay safe vanessa"". that is it.i fucking wish it worked.

"First off: English are not my first language and this post could be a little longer.Writing this feels kind of surreal but I think i need to get it off my chest.I was diagnosed with depressive and social anxiety disorder like a year ago.(Went to therapy)My gf and i broke up with , like 2 months ago. I feel so empty now, the first week after the breakup was not so bad, just weird.But like right now I am pretty close to the edge.I am a failure, got no motivation to doe anything.(shower, work out etc.)It was a relationship of 1,5 years and I just feel like something was ripped out of me.All my happiness, my motivation, my will to live and everything else that made me happy is gone now.She already has a new one.I deleted all of her pics yesterday and it hurt me so much to think about the time with her.I tild myself yesterday:If this doesbt get better in 2022, I am killing myselfI know it sounds harsh but, if my life is not woth living because of the everlasting pain and discomfort inside my head.then why should i keep trying?I already was in a dark place before the relationship ended but this episode is by far the worst i have ever expierienced.Thanks for listening.

"Hi, lately I have been feeling really depressed and I do not know the reason, I have been crying for several days too. Some days are better fortunately but I feel stuck and worried about the impact of my mental health on my future. I cannot get therapy because my mom said I did not have problems when I opened up to her for the first time (I am 17 btw), I guess some parents are not open minded and understanding enough to understand mental illness. When I try to have fun I cannot enjoy it, I always feel either sad or numb. I remember the times when I was not even feeling depressed like that. I hope it gets better one day, but I feel guilty for doing nothing for it. I tried to read books about mental health but I do not have the motivation for it yet.

"Is anyone having a particularly bad time right now? I really need to get outside my head, and maybe gain some perspective through the problems of others. Last summer I lost my job. I have been working towards improving my symptoms, and I do see a steady improvement. A few months ago I could not sleep for more than 3 hours. Falling asleep was almost impossible. My anxiety shot through the roof, as I was having daily panic attacks (a new thing for me). I lost my job, went back to school and got my degree. I am worried all the time. I ruminate all the time. I was bedridden for a few months and I lost about 50 pounds. My muscles have atrophied. My teeth rotted as I was not caring for myself. I am in a lot of pain physically and mentally. I cry multiple times a day sometimes uncontrollably. I will be 30 in less than a year and I feel like I am already dying. All I can think of is the negative, even though I have some positives. I am relatively healthy, no serious physical diseases.I have an amazing and beautiful girlfriend. I love her more than anything and she always returns the love tenfold. She has been trying to support me during this very dark period and I feel horrible for dragging her down. When the depression and anxiety were at their peak I was considering suicide every minute of the day. I had to call the suicide hotline and the lady I talked with used a tough love approach which actually helped put things in perspective. Anyway, even though the symptoms have been improving things keep happening in the middle of my recovery that trigger the anxiety and depression. Just yesterday when I was feeling quite good about my situation, I became the victim of identity theft. Here we go again. One step forward and 10 steps back. I obsess about things, and it has been driving me crazy. There are compounding problems contributing to this hole I have dug besides my mental health. I need a kind stranger to tell me what they are going through as well so I do not feel so alone. I am hurting really bad. My heart and spirit feel broken. Anyone else? Anyone Else Having The Worst Year of Their Lives? I desperately want to feel less alone and reading about the what others are going through helps.",Depression

"(Idk what subreddit to put this in, so I decided to put it in here)Why is it that when someone admits that they may have a bad characteristic, people admire it? They are impressed that someone can admit to having a weakness. Such as being too sensitive, or too inconsiderate, too myopic, too loud, too shy, etc. In general people are impressed that others can admit a weakness about themselves. People admire that you can admit fault and be able to constructively criticize yourself.Now, once you start talking about physical attributes such as being too skinny, or too fat, or not good looking enough its becomes a matter of self esteem. Not a matter of constructive self criticism, its now that you are insecure. They tell you that you need to think better of yourself. That your looks do not define you. ""Work on your self esteem"" or ""You sound insecure"". Why cannot I just peacefully say or admit that I am not good looking? Or that I am not in anyway physically attractive? Why does that make me insecure acknowledging a fact about myself? I know and I am reminded everyday. I can see how I am treated differently as opposed to conventionally attractive people. I know that I have never been liked romantically by anyone. Why cannot people accept that instead of invalidating me and saying I am too negative or that I am just *insecure*?I am not asking for pity or for validation. I just stated a fact that I have observed about myself. If it makes you uncomfortable so be it. But you would be fine if I admitted that I was not outspoken, or a good problem solver right? I would not be insecure, I would just be someone who wants to be better. I am not insecure, I am also not blind. I see myself in the mirror everyday. Pretending that I am attractive is not going to change anything. So stop. Insecurities",Depression

Where I live was going above and beyond with covid restrictions even though people were getting vaccinated and you would be fined for even seeing your family. My parents were being insane, my brother was not doing well, and it took a huge toll on me too.

I honestly do not think I could say the same about any of my siblings, any secondary family members, or anyone else in general. I have become estranged with just about everyone.

I think most of this laziness comes from how mentally strenuous some of my ideas are and whether or not it will even be worth it in the end.

I have family that would forget about me in a month, ""friends"" that do not even care now.

How Pathetic, typing to a bunch of strangers who do not care. why should they. I have tried getting help, but the meds make me feel worse, all of them, the therapists push their agendas, no one is against you, they are only for themselves, but if I am not for myself, then no one is. Worthless. I have even done things that I thought id never do, I have prayed, and prayed, looking, asking for help, for the strength to get rid of my demons, my monsters, to no avail.

I want to help her get on the road to recovery but I do not know what to do. What are the best ways for me to be supportive of my wife dealing with anxiety and depression?",Depression

"I have been walking around being productive, I have a boyfriend, I have emancipation papers (not filled out), I have this big plan on how I am going to go out and live life and pursue college. I have told all my friends that I am going to leave my family (which I feel like is emotionally and mentally abusive but I am not sure) and go get an apartment and finish highschool and go straight to college and then Med school. Problem is, I have not actually done any of that. This past year I got pulled out of school twice for suicide watch, my grades plummeted, I quit my sports team and I cut off most of my friends, I stopped showing up to work and I just tried to not to kill myself. Recently its been getting worse at home. My father has become more controlling, grounding me for stupid things, taking away my car, not letting me see my boyfriend or friends, gaslighting me for not spending time with him, etc. My mother has gotten better she has not manipulated me in a while so I think were fine. Her husband on the other hand, says that I am the reason my mothers health has deteriorated, both of my stepparents have said that I am the reason our family is dysfunctional. Sometimes I like to think I am stronger than others, that I have it worse than my friends, but that is not true at all. I am weaker than all of them. My life is so easy. So why should I want to stop existing? there is been awful shit that is happened when I was a kid Ill admit, but as of late lifes not as bad as it could be. Idk I just feel so stupid.

"that is the question I have been asking myself, for months. I am underage (less than 15) and I think I can asked myself that fricking question. I live with my mom and my two sisters, my dad live in another country with another family. But I do not care, that is not why I am asking myself that. One of my sisters (14 years old) said (when I wad 5/6) that I was a big baby, and that I just needed to suck up my problems and grow up, because that is what adults do. I was 5, why the fvck you want me to act like an adult ?! But I was little, and she was the sister I admired, so I did it. My other sister (17 years old) was the one that I was not really talking to, because of our age difference. But we had the same interest (book, anime, japan, culture...) so we started talking more and more together. But I sincerelly regret it. She thinks that just because she is older than me, she can do what my mom do (scolding me when I do something wrong and all that). And she think it, but WAY too much. Example: one of the day her best friend was home, I did some noise will drinking my chocolate milk and she smashed my head on the cup, and I started crying and bleeding. Her friend told her that she was exagerating and to say sorry or help me but no, she think it was the right thing and she does not cared. Example 2: I started fighting with her (verbally) and she pinned me against the sofa, hurting my shoulders and I pushed her in stomach so I cn go to my room. But there, my other sis (14) literally started beating me up, till I was on the floor, crying and screaming: ""stop ! It hurts ! Stop fucking beating me !!!"" And my sis (17) said: ""stop ! do not get physical !"" But she was the one pushing me on the sofa. When I called my mom, she said she did not want to know anything. Example 3: yesterday (27 july 2021) i was playing fortnite with my cousin (10) and step-sis (10). I am used to curse but they know I was sarcastic. I said shut the f up to my step sis and syam (17 yo big sis name) started yelling at me ""do not talk like that"" like i xas talking ti this bitch. Then she said things like ""y you responding"" (because that is how a conversation works) and at the end she said ""to you think I am your friend"" and i was like: ""well i do not pick people with such petsonnality as my friend"" BUT, since i wanted to finish that argument i just said ""uh... no ?"" And she smashed my head on the switch i was playing with. I screaming ""WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU ???"" and pushed her in the stomch so that crazy would go away. In conclusion, i have a scratch on my face, that i will maybe keep 4ever. Yesterday, because of that, I scarified myself. Its been 13 days I did not do it. I do not care about the mark, but the fact she would want it on my face is what hurts. I tried to end my life multiple times, since I was 9. The first time was because a person in my family r^ped me. Since that I cannot feel pleasure in life, and even if I did forgive that person, she is still horrible with me. My sexuality is a problem. My mom said ""you are lucky I accept you"". Like if you do not think you will accept me, why you did a kid ? But some people get kicked out, so I guess I am lucky. My gender is a problem. I identify myself as a genderfluid person, but he/him pronous are the one I love the most (even if I use all pronous, even it). Who am I is a problem. I need to smile. Always. Even if I am just eating. My mom said these exact words:""Smile. I said SMILE ! Ugh !!! Why will not you smile ?? it is not like you are unhappy either ??? Do you even have a reason to not be hapoy, to smile ???"" Well do I have a reason to smile and to be happy, while I am not doing anything except eating ? And last but not least, what I asked. I never asked to be born, to live with my mother, to go see friends, to go to someone is birthday, to live, to be feed, to have a house or go to school. I only asked a few things, and one of them is to go see a therapist. I asked it. I asked it three time. But even if she said yes, she did not do anything. And so, what am i supposed to do ???I am supposed to smile if I am not ? I am supposed to stay with my mom because she fighted for me for years, even if she do not care about my mental health or well being ? I am supposed to let my sisters hit me, just because they are a few years older ? I am supposed to do things, but how can I do them if I cannot even take care of myself ? What am I supposed to do ?",Suicidal

"I am stuck in loop of traumatic thinking. I normally think about suicide at least once a day, but its constant right now, it does not leave my mind for more than about 10 minutes. I am just constantly imagining killing myself in brutal, vivid detail. For instance, one of the thoughts that keeps popping up is that I want to shoot myself in the head and its like I can *feel* the cold steel of a gun against my head or on the roof of my mouth and my finger squeezing the trigger, even what it would feel like when the bullet pierces my skull. And that just one scenario. In others I slit my throat or my wrists or a whole myriad of other things.I cannot escape thinking about it and I feel like actually doing it would be less traumatic than the thoughts I am having. I do not want to fucking be here right now, I do not know why I am, I guess I am just too weak to do it right now. I wish I had a gun. I hate being alive, I do not want to live. I just do not have a reliable enough way to kill myself.

"I have had larger amounts of stress happen compared to now, but it feels like I have only now caved from it. I left my job about two years ago to take care of my dad while I was in school. It was hell watching him get worse without being able to do anything. I still managed to stay on top of my grades and responsibilities. He passed months ago. Nothing seemed right after, but I had to carry out his will, handle his funeral, etc. so it kept me from just sitting with my thoughts. About a week later I found out my SO was cheating with his kids mom. My grades slipped that semester, but I got them back up and got a new job. Continued repeatedly dealing with shady behavior from SO and being promised change. My mom chose this period of time to behave like she had not in years, disappeared when she met a guy and does not really come around, and cancels when I have tried to come see her. My parents divorced when I was young, she was not close with my dad.These past few weeks I feel I have let myself go. I was struggling with my classes and have just stopped working on them, not even checking the grades. Letting my ex/not ex SO continue to be around despite asking them to let me heal and move on. they have been attentive and loving and stopped drinking but it does not feel the same anymore. I do not think its fair to them because I do not have hope that were going to last and I do not know that I even feel sad about that after giving so many chances. Its not healthy for either of us when there is no trust. I procrastinate all responsibilities, and do not really see myself with a good future anymore, just getting through each day. I feel the panic of how bad I am messing up but will not do anything to start fixing it. I have just mentally checked out from everything aside from my job. I am not sure I want to see a doctor because I fear they will just send me on a journey of different medications to try. Even small tasks like calling a doctor seem strenuous. I do not want to talk to anyone I know about this because I know every person is dealing with their own problems, and cannot really help with mine anyway. Just needed to get this off my chest.

"In 2016, after living by myself, I had to come back to my parents place. I was pretty miserable because my return was the result of several disappointments and failures in a row.The 2 following years were pretty dark, I did not know what to do with myself and a childhood friend that was very dear to me kind of betrayed me and it totally broke my heart.In 2019, I finally found a job that was perfect for me. I knew the place, my boss was very understanding (regarding my shyness, anxiety etc), I was good at it, I got my first salary and the first car etc : Things were getting much better.I did not move out because I was working part time, meaning I was not earning much, and I chose to prioritise spending my little savings into a car rather than an apartment. Then my contract ended and I have been looking for a job since last January. I have been applying to jobs all over the country and oversea, super confident, but I barely get any feedback and when I do, we proceed to have an interview but then I do not hear back from anyone.I was okay with living at home because my mom and brother were still there but she divorced him (which I am happy about, my dad has been sucking the joy out of us and belittling us our entire lives), and my brother left too, so now I am stuck with my dad I cannot even look in the eyes, and broke. I was supposed to live with my mom but her new boyfriend moved in instead. That hurt too but I want to let her live her life with him, she deserves it after years of submission to my dad.I know I could try to apply to a different job that is hiring more in the meantime, but as I mentionned, I am very discreet, anxious, shy, but also clumsy, distracted, and I am pretty sure that I would be a burden and suck at anything that is not of my qualifications. I do not feel capable of doing anything I do not know alreadyIm very alone. I got a couple friends and I am thankful for them but my social life is far from being exciting and my love life is simply inexistant. I was relatively fine with it because frankly relationships scare me, so I was kind of at peace with it, but considering my current situation, that lack of love is adding to my list of what is making me feel worthless. Someone that could make my heart feel a bit lighter would not harm right now.If you read it that far : Sorry, that was a lot of self pity.

"It has been 7 years since my brother died by suicide and honestly, life has never been the same but not better. He killed himself using a gun owned by my father and left a suicide note written in japanese ( he self-studied the language). We never saw the whole note since it was surrendered together with the gun to the police and my parents never wanted to read it. After his death, they burned all of his things (laptop, books, etc.) and never talked about the reason of his death ever again. There was always a time once a year when my curiosity got the better of me (I asked them if they could get a copy of it or if the police can translate it for us) and it always ended with disastrous fights with me against my parents. I always feel like I will never have my peace of mind if I will not be able to read about the letter.In the end, I always feel like the note could be some sort of closure for our family.Today, I feel like I just want to follow my brothers footsteps.

"You hear a lot of teens claiming that they are depressed and when you ask them why, they say it is just life. that is the same person who got nothing to worry about, financially secured, loving parents, spoiled and bright future ahead. I am a 17 year old going through the worst of hell. My father cheated on my mom. He always wanted more. He promised he would pay for my education, he can barely pay my 50$ monthly allowance. While the kids around me are holding IPhones, sipping on Starbucks daily, depressed because their favorite musician produced a sad song. My mom always expected more from me. she is a manipulative bitch. She is Satan's daughter. she is always hated me for no reason. I admit I am a mess, I do not tidy up stuff, I am not that smart, I am not as smart as her firstborn, but I try. I do try my level best, but she does not see it. I scored 7A's and a B in my middle school final year exams, and she said it was a fluke. They did the papers too easy or something like that she meant. Whenever I try to be close with my own mother, she does not see me. She will be on her phone scrolling through Facebook when I try to talk something important to her. She recently told me if I do not do good in my final year exams, she is not going to pay for my college. Her perception of good is straight A's. Online classes are not doing any good for me. She does not care about my mental health or anything. She thinks of it as a simple matter that you can get over it. Basically, she will disown me if I do not do well. Do you see the type of mother I have? She highly praises her firstborn but she does not see anything in me. I helped her a lot with with her work, but I have never heard a thank you before. But I do not know why I still keep doing it. I show that I am okay when I am fucked up in my mind. I have an elder brother, who emotionally abuses me. He reminds me that I am fat and stupid everyday. I do not know if it is his way of showing affection or not. I am not claiming that I have the worst situation of all. There are some people having far more worst than me. I admire those who stick around when it was hell for them.I am sitting here, wondering if it is all really worth fighting for. I might as well live in the afterworld. I so badly want to kill myself. I do not know what is stopping me from doing it. Do I have anyone? No. Some people say that I will meet someone great in the future. What if I do wait, and she does not show up? Am I going to die waiting? I might as well die now when I have no one. At least I am not a burden for my mother if I die. Maybe then she will finally be happy.

I felt sad about it for several years... but I feel like this no more. Getting hookups on tinder, making temporary friends, casual chat with other Xbox players and never talking with them again. I think I stopped GAFOS. Yes, it is good to exchange some messages and stuff, but I just do not care about other people's feelings anymore. I became a cynical person. My depression got worse over time and now I am do not care about what I say, what I do. Not trying to be edgy, trust me.

During a recent interaction, she said she could sense I was going through a tough time and that it must be because I have never prayed to Jesus properly to take it all away. It felt so insulting because as the neglect, abuse, and pain I experienced as a child were happening I prayed my heart out through tears only for nothing to happen.

I am 30, and I have never experienced any kind romantic or sexual intimacy, because I am an ugly gay man and completely inept when it comes to dating (I have no experience). I have been so poor that I cannot feed myself. My career as a professional musician has gone down the tubes because of the pandemic, and I am stuck with a new job that gives me intense anxiety and amplifies my self-hatred. Nobody in my life has any idea it has gotten this bad, and I do not want to reach out to friends or family, because I am sick of the well-intentioned responses that make me feel to blame, or worse about myself.While I do blame myself for quite a lot, I do not blame myself for wanting to die. This world really fucking sucks. I have no hope for society in general - late-stage capitalism and climate change are the terminal cancer of humanity, and I am sure that it is people like me that are going to suffer the worst deaths.I cannot say I have not tried to get better. I have had aloof unsympathetic therapists over the years who have prescribed me medicine I end up not being able to afford. But I still tried. Yesterday, I called down a list 20 therapists covered by my insurance the other day to see if they were accepting new patients and not one of them called me back. I guess I just really do not believe anyone is really equipped, capable, or willing to help me out of this.The obstacles keeping me from killing myself are insurmountable, like knowing the effect it would have on my family, my cat, and the lack of a riskless/painless method. So for now, I guess I am just stuck in this unbearable existence. Being able to kill myself is just as ludicrous of a goal as me finding any level of real or sustainable happiness. I do not know what to do with that other than writhe in agony until my natural time comes. Hell is real, and I am here. the definition of hell",Suicidal
"I cried for the first time in years, the summer class i depended on told me i was not eligible and i could not follow the course anymore after two weeks of learning i enjoyed. My school functions on a modular system which is extremely flawed towards students with undiagnosed ADHD and little autonomy. I love learning but my school does not have teachers, we have modules, 60-130 pages of self-learning. This system where students advance at their own pace is a nightmare for people with un medicated ADHD like me. In part to why i loved my summer class so much was because the teacher would talk to you and guide you through the subject. I wish i had changed schools earlier in my highschool career, its too late for all that. Being a maximum one year behind was my goal and i would have reached it if i had finished 8th grade science when i was 14. In 9th grade they removed my science and social studies subjects to focus on the more ""important"" ones, same for 10th grade. Why would they do this if you need them to graduate? I have planned suicide this whole year, delaying it with the thought that if i finish this summer class i will only have to do two years in one. My second option now gone, I have never been closer to sneaking out and jumping off an abandoned parking lot nearby. I have hit a dead end. I will not graduate and I will not go to college. i will be 16 doing 8th grade science. putting me 3 years behind.",Suicidal
I had a belt tight around my neck twice last night and seemed really motivated to kill myself. I must have punched myself in the head 15 times last night. Thankfully I did not go through with it but it really feels like just a matter of time. My wife and I drink and smoke weed every night and during the day on weekends. Admittedly we are very functional addicts but mentally it is really taking a toll on me. I cannot seem to communicate with her about this though as she gets really upset when I bring up a desire to stop. We often go through stages where we fight all the time and then go long stretches where its all good. I hate myself so much for what I have become and yet I cannot seem to find the motivation to actually make a change for myself. Instead just wishing it changes on its own. Even killing myself I often wish it would just happen like getting hit by a car or something. How awful is that? I am so lazy and lately I cannot even look at myself in the mirror anymore. We have a beautiful daughter who is growing and developing incredibly well so far and I hate the idea of her not knowing her father. At the same time I hate to think of her knowing her parents as scum. Maybe if I kill myself it will shock my wife into cleaning up and then our daughter can thrive with a sober parent. At the same time maybe that is just me trying to rationalize a selfish act so I do not feel as bad. I keep wishing I was a better person and yet never taking any action. I am the only one that can make a change. It does not just happen but I am too lazy and pathetic to actually do anything. Someday it will happen and the thoughts will stop. I am just looking to get this off of my chest - please disregard,Suicidal
"My dream is to live on a farm. Maybe not a whole farm, but I want a cute little cottage big enough for two cats, a dog or two, some chickens, and a garden. To live in a small town, preferably where family values are still alive. Id love to have someone to love and cherish, and wed have a kid or two one day. My husband would be really nice to me and not make fun of me or compare me to other girls and make me feel like a failure for being born. I want to be known as that cute, polite, mysterious farm girl instead of a depressed, anxious orphan. To finally have someone I can tell my story to and they would hug me and comfort me and tell me its going to be okay, instead of just saying that is rough.

TRIGGER WARNING ..........I was violently raped in 2015 and I still have flashbacks. This is one factor in my decision to commit suicide. I am in therapy but I just do not think I can get over it and I think this is why I cannot make friends because it was basically date rape. And the fact that it was date rape fucks me up too. It feels like it was less of a rape because the judge claims that because I willingly went to the guys house (after meeting him twice at restaurants) that it was not considered rape.

"My names Joey. Ever since about 4th grade I have had anxiety because my teacher was a total prick and he would yell at the class and be mentally abusive as fuck to us. So not sure if that is part of my trauma. ik I am not as strong as some people but that def added to part of my trauma.. anyways i developed a social anxiety and generalized anxiety disorder which hindered my ability to make friends, so i had like 3 friends max.. i only talked to them sometimes too, not even close friends because of my anxiety and lack of motivation. i would spend all day playing on my laptop when i was a bit younger because it was an escape for me. I could just avoid my life and play video games all day because my parents are lenient. I started developing a depressive disorder, probably because i also started smoking weed about a gram a day of some strong dispensary weed for about 3/4 of a year. My brain was fucked i could not think at all, could not concentrate on anything for more than like a minute, hell i could not even concentrate or remember like anything from like the past day or two.. I was contemplating just starving myself to death because i did not know what the fuck to do but i realized that there is other ways.. not at the time.. but now.. i got a nurse practitioner who gave me Citalopram(antidepressant ssri), and recommended counselling and i accepted the counselling at the time. I declined later on when i got a phone call from the receptonist to make a counselling appointment or whatever, because i thought i was feel better, and i was. the side effects sucked. no sex drive really and insomnia. then i started smoking about a gram a day again which in about 5 days i went into a psychosis and got extremely anxious, agitated, panicky, and even yelled at my parents and told my mom to fuck off because she thought it was just anxiety and i knew it was not. Anyways she was broken inside because of her anxiety disorder and she could not handle it. I am out of psychosis now and looking into antidepressants again with something to help me sleep. I think it was the weed combo that did that sorry for wasting your time if you r reading this ik its a lot of writing. here is my story (15M)",Depression
"Hi, I always wanted to talk here but never did. I have depression since age of 10, I am 18 years old. I lost a huge amount of my memory power, like if I have dementia, it is the most annoying shit. Because of that, my brain decided to go full on stupid since 6th grade. The funny part is that i get reminded of that a lot, in school for instance, people know I have autism (asperger) and they ALWAYS expect me to be some kind of genius and then get disappointed right in front of me (one big reason why I hate human beings). I also lost all the human fear of death, like, in 2017 i got threatened with a knife by the bully I beated the day before. He came from behind me (that is what sh-) with a sharpened knife touching me while saying he would kill me, and I said that he should do it fast then because if i got that knife I was going to pull his guts out with it. And he just ran away and hid from me everyday in school. So anyway, that is it, I will go listen to Soundgarden, Joy Division and Misfits all day, like always. Bye Fear of the D(eath)ark.",Depression

"Remember that all we have is 'on loan' from Fortune, which can reclaim it without our permission - indeed, without even advance notice. Thus, we should love all our dear ones, but always with the thought that we have no promise that we may keep them forever - nay, no promise even that we may keep them for long. ~ Lucius Annaeus Seneca (Cannot find the source)The most sobering thought is losing what we care about. Would we be able to move on, survive and flourish without our loved ones, whether they have passed on or we have? Some of us, I think. I can say that I have experienced enough of loss to understand that life goes on with or without me, and I can say that I would feel a pang of sadness whensoever their memory comes to mind. But I feel I would do this survival thing just as well if not better after that loss.I would not sully their memory by grieving them for the rest of mine. I would remember them by being better than they remember, so that, should we reunite wherever the universe decides we do, they would enjoy seeing me again, and sharing in my joys instead of my sorrows. I would like to imagine that this is how the old peoples did it.Bare with me, I have a silly idea that maybe, when the Norse, Greeks, Egyptians, Celtics and more, spoke about the idea of death, and what it was to live life after (because surely they did), they sat around their grand tables, talking of stories they heard as children, told to them by their parents, who were in turn told by their parents, and so on until the first story was made up in an answer to the age old question no one can answer. What happens after death? On a side note, I like to think the first story ever came to existence because a a child had asked this in front of the elder of the tribe, who had made his living from leading the tribe that trusted him. This elder never would have led his people wrong, and they would have led a happy, content life. This elder would be the one the whole tribe went to for advice. So of course, he did not want to let the child down. So he told a story. Something from his dreams that were impossible. And he took bits from others dreams and weaved a world after death.And people believed it. Because the elder never lied to them. The elder always led them in the right direction. The elder had lived the longest so the elder knew more than they they. The elder experienced the most out of them all. The elder would know. So they added to his story on death, and made up the gods, and the fantastical dragons, and other beasts of lore. They made up their magics and prophecies. All chasing after their own form of heaven after death, while others would forever be stuck in a hell of their own making. So that is how we got these gods and myths and legends. And that is why stories are so powerful, especially for a child's imagination. The fortunate child who does not fully understand the idea of loss and death, and is fueled on bedtime tales. Until they experience it, of course. And then they have to rely on what is told to them by the elders they know, and they carry that with them. And so it creates a ripple effect, their idea of after life pervading into all that they say and do. And that is how they cope with losing loved ones. They tell themselves over and over again, they are in Odin's hall, or at Arthur's table, drinking their mead and telling their tales of glory. Being happy. So if, after you die, you go to join them at the table, and they want to hear your tales of glory, would you tell sad stories about how you have missed them, and how your life fell apart after they left you, and you got worse and all these bad things happened? Would you tell you them that you have lived poorly because they were your only reason for being happy? Or would you tell tall tales of how you fought the bad dragons of the world just to make it a better place for their children, for their loved ones, and for yours. Would you tell them that they inspired you to new heights. You did they things they did not get to, and you can tell them what it is like. To do the former is to blame them for their death, and how hurtful is that to someone you loved? To tell them that their death, their inescapable cycle of life, made their loved ones lives in this already inescapable hell we live in, worse.But to do the latter is to truly put them at rest, at peace. knowing that their loved ones have thrived without them, have lived and have known a great amount of joy after the universe has given you your time. That they have made the world better, have made life more fun to live. Or at the least, have a good story to tell. To bring it back, I want to dissect what I feel is the most important part of Seneca's statement, that we should love all our dear ones. We do not know when we will lose them, although if you are losing them because of your actions, you should be well aware of those consequences. So while we share our lives and experiences with them, we should show our love for them. We should share our joys, and try to be better for their sake, if not our own.After all, No one wants to sit at a table and share drugs with the inconsiderate, deceitful, abusive, prideful, greedy, and murderous. I do not think I need to explain why. Live life Loving, and you will love after life",Depression

"I often fantasize about suicide on days where my inner rage and low self esteem surface and I am unable to stuff it out of my consciousness. I doubt my relationships, feel broken and worthless and I cannot pin my inner rage to anything in particular. I was molested by my uncle as a young boy which has likely fucked me up in irreversible ways. I am in a long term relationship with a woman and am unsure if I truly love her or if I am settling because I hate being alone and feel I cannot do any better. I do not know what to do or how to improve my psyche. I am seeing a therapist and taking medication but it does not seem to have much effect. I also have a rough job that pays me well over six figures a year so that I am trapped by golden handcuffs. I do not know how people like me make it to old age. Its hard to say if I will or not. Passive thoughts on bad days",Suicidal
"For the record, I am not suicidal and I never have been. But I am going to tell you something, a true story, that might make you think another way.For background, My mom's friend, who I will call ""Susan"" speaks Russian and English, so she works in translation at hospitals in the you.S.Susan had a client, who I will call ""Sandra"" was living in Russia. Sandra's son, living in America told her to come live with him there. She at first declined, saying Russia was were her friends and job were. But after a while, she agreed. But when Sandra lived here, she fell in a deep depression. She did not fit in, she did not like her job. She would spend a lot of time just watching TV. Sandra starts feeling suicidal, not caring about life. Always saying she wants to die. She becomes isolated, smoking and occupying her time with herself. Smoking a lot. After a while, she visits her friends in Russia. They tell Sandra they are worried about her cough. Sandra brushes it off as a little side-effect of smoking. Returning to the you.S., Sandra's son expresses the same concern. She says the same thing, but they decide to take her to a doctor. Inoperable, Incurable Stage 4 Lung Cancer.Instantly, her whole attitude changes.The amount of time she spent hating life, not caring, she regrets it. She realizes how important it is, and what she has. She has a few months left to live. And she appreciates it so much more.My point to you is this: I do not know what you are going through. I do not know how you feel. But I know that if you push past pain and try, and maybe you will have to try hard; to try hard to appreciate life, you will enjoy life. You will not regret hating life and feeling like you do not matter, like Sandra did. Because like her, you will come to regret it.I hope this reaches out to you, and guides you to a better place.

"Firstly, I just know that I will not ever be able to transition to how I want to be. I will not be able to get top surgery, or hormones or whatever because that shit is too expensive and I can barely make enough money to pay rent as it is.I do not have insurance, I am struggling to make money, and I barely have any skills that I am proud of. I am walked all over by everyone I know because I am a people pleaser. I just want to snap at everyone one day. I want to isolate myself from everyone I know. I just want to stop existing in the eyes of everyone I know.I try to ground myself, do that stupid coping skill shit, but it just does not work. Medication does not work for me either, I have tried. Therapy maybe worked for a little bit but I never really got to the things that I really needed to get through in the 3 years I went. Maybe I should become an alcoholic as soon as I can legally buy alcohol. It runs in the family after all. I do not see any point in trying so Ill just throw everything away as soon as I possibly can. I do not even know how the fuck I have gotten as far as I have in life. And I am barely scraping by. I often have fantasies of the train tracks near my house. Its only a 10-15 minute walk to get there. I think about putting my head onto the tracks, listening to music, and closing my eyes. The only reason I have not done it yet is because I am scared.The only reason is instinctual self preservation. And I hate it. I do not have the balls to just up and leave in the middle of the night because I feel like my roommate would figure it out. Or maybe not, idfk. Maybe if I just pretend everything is fine for a little longer I can leave without a trace, and no one will notice until its too late. Hopefully it would be successful so that I would not have to deal with hospital fees. Tbh I do not think there is any coming back from a train crushing your head in anyways. No one would notice if I disappeared one day. I am going to go nowhere in my life. I will not transition, I will not be successful, I will not have anything good going for me.",Suicidal
"No, really? Why have we have a species survived this long? I do not get how people can just live like this without killing themselves. I feel like my family, therapist, etc. think I am crazy every time I bring it up.I do not want to have a job and I do not see why everyone collectively agreed that wasting your entire week doing mind numbing bullshit that you hate was any way to live. I ended up quitting my last job after a few days. Just walked out on my lunch and never came back because I could not stop myself from crying. I get exhausted so easily, and cannot really do much for more than a few hours without feeling like I am going to pass out, and it is so frustrating. I was taking caffeine pills to keep me awake at work but they did not do shit. Maybe it is a medical thing, or because I am autistic, or maybe I am just fucking lazy. I dunno, but whatever it is, it made me sleep for 16 hours straight after returning from my first shift. I tried to kill myself the night after my second one. I kind of wish I actually wanted to die. I used to, when I was younger, but I did not really have any means of doing it. Eventually, I taught myself to find things worth sticking around for, no matter how small they are. But it backfired, because I feel like I have no choice but to kill myself, because I was born into a world I am not cut out for. Now the things that previously were keeping me here are just things I have no choice but to leave behind, and it hurts more than if there was just nothing. Does that make sense? No? let us move on,I am stuck relying on my parents for the time being which I hate because I know they just see me as a leech. They try to sugarcoat it but it is obvious that my dad resents me and I am just waiting for the point where he cuts me off financially because I know it is inevitable (especially due to the fact that I am trans and closeted and they are both far-right wackjobs who are a few Facebook links away from thinking the Earth is flat.)So having any long term goals or aspirations seems really pointless, knowing everything can all get sucked out from underneath me the instant they find out.Ok I am tired of typing now. going to go pass out. what is the point?",Depression
"I am such a horrible piece of shit, it is no wonder I am losing people left and right. I get why I am alone and everyone hates me. I will probably be forever alone assuming I do not send myself into hell itself in the next hour.I think at this point I deserve to be alone, and hated by everyone, to have no one care about me, ever. I probably should just off myself right now, so people would not have to deal with me anymore. I cannot do it anymore, why could not I have been better, why cannot I fix myself, why was I even born?I am not sure how much more I can lose before I just do not care anymore I am losing everyone I care about and I cannot handle it anymore",Suicidal
"I think I finally hit that point where I am at ease with dying. I have a plan 99% sure it will work, after doing extensive research. God if my dad saw my search history yikes. I am going to pay off the bill I owe to my grandparents get rid of some of my stuff so my dad do not have to and then Ill just do it. My dad + his gf are never home, I am a adult so it do not matter. But I know when I am ready they will be gone for the weekend and I can do it. They probably will not find my body for a while because they only come in my room every couple of months I am always at work or sleeping so it does not really matter. Either way I am at the point where I know I am ready. Having it planned out has me a peace which is weird but I guess that is how you know its your time. 19F",Suicidal

I am scared and anxious to even reach out to anyone for help. I am just going to get ignored? Maybe not, but it is how I always feel. The horror stories that I have read about hotlines not picking up make it worse.&amp;#x200B;I constantly feel like I am a waste of space.

"I do not see a point to anything anymore. I believe I have identified it as apathy. But as far as I can rationalize it I exist on this planet to live for an arbitrary reason, and then die. Full stop. I cannot find meaning, I have been trying so fucking hard but I just cannot. I have everything I could want In life but I find joy in none of it. I used to love gaming, and travelling. As of the past couple years I have not felt excited for either in any capacity. I have not felt anger, happiness or sadness in what feels like a lifetime. All I am experiencing is boredom and apathy. I am not even sure if what I am experiencing ***is*** depression, but from what I can tell, its at least a form of it. I have been to therapists and psychologists, I have tried CBT. None of it has worked. I am trying to avoid anti-depressants but I hate the sound of the side effects, especially the ones related to sex. Sex is one of the last things that distracts me from what I am experiencing, although I am afraid I am developing an addiction to it. I am not even suicidal. I just feel so jaded and tired of living. But I do not see a way out. Being dead seems worse but I do not know where to go from here. I am a conventionally attractive, young, college student who is been in a stable relationship for 5 years with a gorgeous, amazing girl. And I am absolutely depressed beyond reason.",Depression

"It is difficult for me to confront a simple problem. I cannot do anything. I cannot sleep. I have anxiety every day and I hate what I am doing. I thought before that I could fix everything in one day but it has been months of the same thing where every day ends the same way.

"I suppose I just need a place to vent. The past year has been terrible, horrid. And even with summer rolling through, I feel this utter disgust at myself and who I am; it is no longer a probability that I was going through seasonal affective disorder or whatever it is called. I am at least not as severely depressed, but there really is not a day that goes by where I do not think about killing myself. I just think not many people in my circle, perhaps anyone, is really ready to have that conversation, even those who know of my feelings and thoughts. Of course, people are dealing with their own issues, especially during this pandemic, I just cannot help but feel like I have been going through these episodes of depression for the last five years. Five whole years of contemplating suicide. I am not alone in how I feel, but it never ceases to seem so isolating and that I am truly alone. Even getting a full time job did not make anything better; it dawned on me that this will be the rest of my life--wake up, work, eat, sleep. And everyday what I want to achieve and pursue seems that much farther away. Life cannot just be this, or else what is the point? It seems as though the most feasible way of alleviating this malaise is just ending it all, never needing to worry about life again. It never really went away",Depression

Do I have a symptom/am I crazy?Okay so I (14F) have a sister(16F). And were pretty close like really really close. Our mother passed away when we was younger(she was murder) . 7 and 5 years old. So its really just us to against the world. My sister is really quiet and does not talk to no one. While I on the other hand is completely the opposite. But ig after my mother passing and other shit happening. I have this feeling to protect my sister from everyone and everything. Like I never been away from her for more then 3 days. And if she does not go then I will not go and vis-versa ( sorry for bad spelling) but yea I am usually the one to do everything(which I have no problem with) and I always keep track of my sister to protect her from anything and anyone because I do not want to lose her. ( our dad is not in our life) but whenever my sister goes to work we share locations so I check it every 5 minutes. Because every negative possibility fills my head that something is happening to her like she is getting murdered or something. She understands how I feel when it comes to her for the most part. But then a lot of times at night I go into her room and just cry because I cannot stop myself from thinking someone is going to kill her while she is sleep and take her from me. And I just watch by the door with something sharp. Waiting for someone to try to take her from me. And she is knows and she tells me nothing is going to happen but I cannot help it. Like she is mine(my sister) I cannot let anything happen to her. I have no memory of our mom. But all I know is once I saw her in the casket. I vowed to let nothing happen to my sister. But I think there something wrong with me because sometimes when I am by myself I just talk out of nowhere forming a plan to kill anyone that try to hurts my sister. And it feels like someone is talking back to me . But I do not even care I just want to keep my sister safe. So is there something wrong with me? Please help me.,Suicidal

I love everyone in my life and I do not want them to be sad, but if things do not work out I cannot stay. it is stupid, but I do not want to grow old alone, I know I joke about being the crazy old guy in the woods but I do not want that. I want a family with the person that I fall in love with. I want a house and a yard so I can watch my kids (whether they are ours or adopted) grow up and hopefully be the father I wish I had when I was little. I want to go on adventures with someone and be able to have those stupid little moments where you know you have each others back 100% or you look in that person's eyes and you know they love you. I feel like my chances are all but gone and I do not want to be here if they are. Whenever I hang out with my friends I feel like the creepy old guy. I feel like I am intruding on the fun that everyone is having and they keep me around because they feel bad. I have become socially awkward, I cannot keep eye contact with people like I used to. I do not want to feel like this anymore. Idk if I am legit autistic or I have some sort of developmental issue in my brain because I have always had friends younger than me and maybe I am stupid or something and my brain is stunted so I cannot relate to people my age. I do not want to live a life where I am the dude always tagging along to friends events or camping trips alone. I feel broken. I know something is wrong with me and I do not know if I can fix it. Idk even how I was able to to trick my ex into being with me but I know why she cheated. It was me. I was not a good husband even though I tried and I do not think I will ever get another chance. I do not want to die alone but I think I might have to and it is better to do it earlier rather than waiting around till I am 35 or 40. it will give people time to forget about me. This is all stupid as fuck. It all comes down to being alone and my brain not being able to handle it. Maybe I am being punished for the horrible shit I have done, whether it is a God, or the universe or something else I really do not know. I just know I will not let myself live alone forever Opened up to a friend tonight. I am not okay and she knows that an is encouraging me to tell another friend so they can both help. I am trying to get better but my brain is telling me I am being manipulative and to just end it anyway. I only have a few friends my own age most are younger by 5 years",Suicidal
"I have been feeling pretty weird and detached. My boyfriend and I just got through a series of arguments, we both apologized to each other but I still have a hard time being close with him because of my own internal issues. it is hard for me to feel close to anyone right now. Stressful events always send me into a dissociated state it just depends how hard. Recently, on top of this, I was physically assaulted by a drunk guy. did not even know it was coming, I think that was the most jarring part about it. He was another resident of the house I am currently living at and pretty much harrassed me passive aggressively from the moment I moved in. My weight has dropped so low because my appetite is gone from stress. I am approaching under a hundred, its very bad but I just cannot make myself eat. I have such an intense sense of dread that it makes me feel like I am going to die soon. Not even suicidal, just that I am at the end of my life if that makes sense. I get weird panic attacks where I am inconsolable one second, and then I pop back pretty much normal the next. Chores overwhelm me much faster, I have to fight myself to stay out of bed and even then I can only accomplish half of what I wanted to do. I feel very isolated and alone.Hopefully this will all pass soon, I am already so tired. Vent dump",Depression
"I used to feel empty inside almost all the time. it is like a void inside which seems like non-fillable but few months back I decided to do something about it. I did not want to feel like crap all the time. So I started on self development.I started small like waking up early instead of sleeping till 10 or 11 am and letting my depression and sadness sink in . Then when It became slightly bearable, I started programming again (I used to be good at it but my depression took the fun out it). I admit this was a hard road since I was out of practice and when I was unable to code. I used to think how I wasted so many years being depressed and thus subconsciously slipping into it again.Again I had to pull myself together.This feels like never ending process since I have been depressed half of my life (I am 23M :p) but atleast I was not that sad anymore.So six months down the line.I am brushing up my maths (important for programming)Working out few times a week.Learning guitar (bought it years back but you know depression)I have still social anxiety and I am social awkward but that is another days problem. Right now I am working on my depression. Filling the void.",Depression
"I am guessing a lot of depressed ppl went through some version of this in quarantine but over the last 2-3 years I basically cut ties with pretty much all my friends. I had several mental breakdowns that made me alienate the closest people (personal and professional) around me, and dropped out of two promising graduate programs as a result. After being hospitalized and put in the psych ward I cannot even buy a gun to end my suffering when no one fucking cares. Anyone I tried to reach out to (first time in over a year) have ghosted me. So I deleted all my photos and contacts permanently... I just do not want to exist anymore. I am alone and I just want the pain to stop.Now living with my mom for over two years now in my late 20s (soon early 30s, although I think I will definitely end my life if I have to suffer that much longer) and the end is not in sight. I am trying really hard but I cannot seem to reach the next step... I got a part-time job that pays well but even that small amount of work terrifies me. I barely manage to make it through the week without impulsively jumping in front of a car or off a balcony. I am afraid that I cannot do anything right anymore. I literally forgot how to talk to people and be a normal non-suicidal person. My therapists recommended that I get an emotional support puppy but now that is just another expense that I have to keep up with. And I basically burned all bridges with anyone who would write me a decent reference letter.People keep telling me that I am going to eventually scrape my way out or that I can start fresh again but I do not want to start fresh again or scrape my way out of this shithole. I am tired of failing, I am just tired. I want it to stop. I depressed myself into too deep of a hole, now I have no way out and want to kill myself even more",Depression
"The Earth is fucked. Climate change is just going to get worse and at this point I cannot do anything about it. The corporations and billionaires are just going to keep exploiting and raping the world of all of its treasures and natural beauties. I do not want to live in a world that is on its death bed. what is the point of going to college right now when I am not going to get a good job anyways. I may as well drop out and get a shit job because that is what Ill end up with no matter what. would not it be better if I just killed myself and rid the world of one less wasteful person? Population is an issue anyways. I do not want to work my entire life, never being able to retire. I fucking hate that I am addicted to my phone because its one of the only things I can occupy myself with without cutting myself to shreds. I became an adult last year and all I wish I could do is either die or go back to the ignorance and bliss of childhood. I want to be a happy idiot instead of a sad one. All that would make me happy is for me to live in the woods away from all people until I starve. I used to want to study film in school, and now that I am, all I want to do is quit. There is no money in making films when you have no talent or skill. I made the deans list after torturing myself this year as a freshman and instead of feeling any accomplishment, I just feel like I have to make it again this year or Ill just quit school all together. It does not even mean much because I am a fucking film student. I am wasting my time with a major that is a scam. The only issue is that there is nothing else in the world that I would study. I am stuck. I am not talented and I do not even know if I enjoy film so now I am just going to be stuck with a major that will not give me and chance of success in life.I am so done with this bullshit world but Id be lying if I were to say that I was going to kill myself. I do not even have the balls for that. I think about it every day but I am not brave enough to do it. I may even join the military and hope that I can die. Everything is fucked",Depression
"I am a 17 year old trans guy and I have got two older sisters and a younger brother.

My mother acts like the victim all the time so its always he hurt her and hes fine its all her she is depressed also my grandfather passed away he was my idol it destroyed me when we lost him but all she was interested in was the money and the house yet she constantly uses it as something to make me and my younger brother breakdown and cry for because she is seeking pitty for what she is doing to us when my father left my mother started talking and bringing a large amount of men around sometimes saying we should call them daddy some were dealers some were addicts some were both and whenever we expressed that we were uncomfortable with the situation at hand she became very agitated and would blame us for her so called depression and say things to the effect of regretting our existence she nolonger hits us but she always threatens to over small things like not cleaning the house we live in completly and when we do she then seeks out a different reason or creates a reason to then yell at us she sometimes goes and acts like she is going to get a gun saying we are the reason she is going to kill herself but never does anything with it they belonged to my grandfather she tells my 11 year old brother that hes so disrespectful to the women who almost died giving birth to him and always throws that in his face as if he chose to be birthed out of her she says she cannot tell me anything in fear that ill end my own life yet she tells me everything at one point she had become agitated because for a few days she had been leading me and my brother to our darker days and we would have killed ourselves if we did not care for eachothers lives my brother sadly walked in on me with a blade and i walked in on him with one aswell so e bad been keeping our distance from her and when our father came over to see us ehich he never does anymore my mother threatened him and then when e got inside she took my phone and my brothers phone so we could not get help as soon as she was done yelling at me i went into my bedroom full mental breakdown ended up cutting not deep enough because she threw my phone at me and left but it was already to late and my brother came into my room begging me to not leave him and my mother came into my room screaming at us again i literally was in the process of ending my life then she wanted me to open up to her and talk to her get i could barely breathe because i was crying and everyone who knows ne knows i have a thing with people touching me it takes me to a really dark place especially when I am sad and my mother restrained me and layed on me and i still could not breathe in that time i screamed like a baby for a while after her new man pulled her off of me and left i was stuck screaming and acting like a baby i could not act other way it was like i was looking through a glass at what i was doing i had calmed down thanks to my brother and when i seen the marks she left on my wrists i scratched myself until i could not see them anymore and then went numb both emotionally and physically also so my mother will not let me work because as long as she is buying everything i must do whatever she says or my basic needs are taken away she gets angry when i defend my father saying he was never there for me which he was not i raised myself all they ever did was feed me and keep a roof over my head but my father never treated me to bad like my mother my entire life i was ignored I have been suicidal as long as i can remember and trust me i have credible reasons for being suicidal not that i need justification but i needed it for everyone anyways any time i tried to reach out and get help it always ended badly even my therapist said i should have chosen a more definate way of suicide as soon as i came out to my mother she only calls me by very feminine pronouns such as baby girl, mami, beautiful and so on along with constantly deadnaming me even when corrected and my father only talks to me when he needs something or wants to talk to my brother yet I am the family therapist and nobody can handle the truth that i tend to say because i can nolonger handle the bullshit they put me through i still have to live so that my brothers got a chance but as soon as i can get him out of here I am leaving and likely never coming back fuck this family and she keeps telling me that I am selfish and stupid and that nobody would side with me because what my dad did to her justified it and i should hate him for it so please tell me am i in the wrong or is it them Am I inconsiderate or is my mom toxic and my dad a dead beat I will likely delete this soon so please read this i just need one person to be on my side who is not in the situation with me",Depression
"Whenever I feel anger, sadness, frustration, or any other negative emotion, there was a number of ways for me to escape. Such as going on a walk, biking, hanging out with friends, and such. A personal favorite is just listening to music. However, it seems like recently nothing is helping. As if I have used it so much that I grew tolerance. Like drinking so much coffee that you do not feel energized. I have been feel more stress, dread, and frustration that I cannot even listen to a very good song without thinking about my mistakes and how shitty I am. I cannot stop thinking about how much I hate being myself. These escapes were my way of feeling better, and I could not and still cannot seem to talk to anyone because it feels that it would not help. I would just feel even more shitty by making them feel worried.I just want to be able to listen to music and relax. Losing My Escapes.",Depression

"I suppose I have made an inch of progress since I have last felt the need to post here. My current job has been extraordinarily stressful for a long time. I have known for months, if not over a year, that I need to find somewhere else. Yet despite knowing that, I would get so scared about the thought of applying somewhere else, about having to go through the process of putting in that two weeks notice.So that was my situation. Too scared to hunker down and take care of the things that would make my current job better, yet too scared to push forward.My situation is not much different, but I have that inch of progress I have made in the past few weeks. I finally managed to get myself to apply to some other places. Only two so far, but maybe I can find some more. Or maybe I get lucky and I will hear back from one of these.Just going slow. I do not want to end up at a job that will make me feel the same, or potentially even worse, than I do now.I wish I was not going slow. I fantasize in my head that I will just hear back immediately from one of these jobs I have just applied to and I will be out of here. But these things take time, and as much as I wish it was not like this, I will probably need to apply to more than two places.I suppose I am not actively suicidal, but have been engaging in some reckless behavior. I do not really want to but after not putting in the effort to progress out of here I am tired and feel the need to cope in shitty ways.Just want out of here. Wish I would just quit. I have plenty saved but I just get concerned about having trouble getting a new job if I quit one out of the blue. that is my irrational brain, so concerned about keeping a job I would drive myself to an unintentional suicide, maybe intentional if it gets worse.Guess I got to just fight for that next inch of progress.

"I miss my Danish friend. We met on reddit, he saw my post at r/selfie and came to talk to me. His name was Michael, he said he worked in Germany. He was a pansexual and had some lovers. He wanted me to be his lover.We were similar in personality and hit it off, he could fully understand me, even my slight sadness. I have never met such a person in real life before. We got along very well and talked about everything. I trusted him, he liked me. He was like another soul of mine. He also said that I reminded him of his past self. He was always gentle and considerate, just like a band-aid, covering my pain.However, from the beginning to the end, we only knew each other for about half a month. My days are numbered, so I said goodbye to him ten days ago. He did not respond to my message. But I am not disappointed, because this is his behavior style.Strangely, since then, I have never dared to review our chat records. As if suddenly, they became deserted ruins, overgrown with weeds, which seemed to be unreal.I cannot even think about how happy we used to be, and occasionally I shudder at the thought. Those memories have sunk into the darkness, and Michael seems to have completely disappeared.Yesterday, I went to talk to him again. I know, no one will respond to me. But, I am dying, I just want to find a place to talk to myself. However, when I wrote the first message, I suddenly collapsed. I felt like I have returned to an abandoned home, with old furniture still in place, but people were gone.I sat on the empty bed, trembling, waiting for his appearance. I felt like I was writing to a ghost. I expected him to hug me, kiss me, comfort me, and stretch out a pale hand and touch me in the dark.How unreal online relationships are. Are all the stories of your lovers true? Does your voice, my name written on your hand really belong to a man named Michael? Why are you so hesitant when I want a picture of you without a beard?I am weak and have a headache. it is raining outside. Today, I am going to commit suicide.

I regret my suicide attempts that left me hospitalized then were not successful, as slightly more than a decade later I am just as miserable, but have no optimism like I did then.All I have wanted out of this miserable life has been to be loved, and after a lifetime I thought I found it. I learned another language, saved several thousand dollars, gave up all my worldly possessions, my pets, and moved to the other side of the planet to be with my spouse, who decided they did not love me, but only loves me like a friend. Now I sleep alone in a bed for two, in a life devoid of happiness and meaning, all before the age of 30. I have no home to return to in the country from which I came (I was just born there/grew up there, I feel no attachment to it anyways or desire to return) and I will always be a foreigner where I now reside, struggling to make ends meet in a developing country.I have managed to save several dozen different benzodiazepines to mix and take with a bottle of spirits once I finally reach my breaking point which I feel is soon. If I could tell a younger version of myself anything it would be that life does not get better, and to just give up already. Honestly this is my advice for anyone else who is nave enough to think there is a future worth looking forward to too I suppose. ""In life, there is no happiness, only the illusion of it.""",Suicidal

"I (M20) had to end things with my girlfriend (F20) of 1 year. She had to move to another state for reasons beyond her control, and I am definitely not in a place in my life right now where I could drop everything and move with her, even though I would in a heart beat.This happened in January earlier this year, now it is almost August and I feel no different than I did the night she left. I actually feel worse. I loved her so much, and she loved me the same. If we had broken up in some big fight or something, it would have been way easier to move on, because then at least I would have something to be angry at her for, something I could remember to remind myself that it was bad. But it was not bad at all. Every day with her was amazing. The last night I saw her, we even said ""I love you"" to each other. We truly loved each other, we did not want it to end. I still text with her pretty often. I know it would be better to stop so I can move on, but I just cannot. I cannot imagine my life without her in it. If I stopped talking to her all together, I would really feel like I would lose her forever, the one person who made me the happiest I have ever been in my life. And I just cannot. I cannot stop thinking about her, and it is only gotten worse over time. Nothing distracts me anymore, movies, video games, exercise, nothing works. I can only think of her. I have done nothing but lay in bed staring for the last 3 weeks. I can hardly even fall asleep, and when I do it is only for a few hours before I wake up again filled with anxiety and panic. My brain cannot help but picture her with other guys, and even though I know she is not that kind of girl, it still kills me. I cannot handle knowing if another man gets to be with her, it would finally kill me.The worst part is, I think she is moved on. she is going on and living her life, and I am a miserable piece of shit who cannot get out of bed. I used to think it was just as hard for her, now I am not so sure. I could not help but tell her how I feel, it was eating me alive. She said that she still cares about me and that she does still love me, but she said I should try to move on. I asked her if she moved back if she would go out with me again, and she said maybe. But since she is not moving back, and she has her own life somewhere else now, it really cannot happen, at least for a few more years until either of us could move ourselves. But even then, I do not think she would wait.I kind of rambled on here, but basically I do not know how to move on. I am still insanely in love with her. Even though I KNOW it cannot happen, and I keep telling myself that, but it does not matter. I need her. I do not just need anyone, I had a few solid chances to get new girlfriends since she left. I turned all of them down because I could not stop thinking about her. This is just killing me slowly and painfully. I seriously do not know how I can go on without her.TL;DR - I still love my ex so badly it is killing me. I cannot move on no matter what I do. I cannot move on from my ex and it is killing me inside",Suicidal
"I basically was on my own in school from 6th til graduation and I barely scraped by.

That was not enough, I need a ""real job"". My job is all manual labor and very real I just accepted shit pay bc I am terrified to speak up for myself. If I were to go to college I would be a burden to them and if I do not I am a waste of potential. Absolutely nothing I do matters to them.

"This is this first time I have ever made a post here on reddit, so I apologize in advance for this not being very well written. I have had clinical depression and generalized anxiety disorder since I was 13 years old, I am now 18. This summer I have reached an ATL, or an all time low. I was hospitalized in January of this year and did not think my situation could get worse from there. I was wrong. I have driven away all of my friends with my erratic behavior and selfish choices, including my best friend from high school who I considered to be a platonic soul mate. I miss them and think about them every day, but they want nothing to do with me. I have never felt more alone than I have this summer. Luckily, my boyfriend of 2 years has stuck around, but today I found out that I am pregnant with his child. I am going to college in the fall and I am not ready to be a parent. The only logical option I have is to get an abortion, I have scheduled one for the end of this week. I am terrified about paying for it, I am a dependent on my parent's insurance, but they are catholic and cannot know about what is going on. I already feel an immense amount of guilt about screwing up and getting pregnant in the first place, I do not need or want my parents to think of me as a murderer on top of that. I feel incredibly hopeless and guilty and like the world's biggest fuck up. I am scared and I feel like no one around me can help. All time low somehow just got lower",Depression

"how do you all, seeking here, not sure what for... (27yoM)I have been having difficulties with my mental health for some time now, but I feel it is reaching new depths - I am now more happy to spend multiple days in bed, comfortable and bored, than out of bed; attempting to progress, in any sense. I suppose it is far more comfortable to be low than it is to be perpetually anxious.I feel like I have read so much of the self-help literature out there, so it is obvious to me what must be done to pull myself out of this slump, ie; take responsibility and be accountable for yourself and your movements; recognise that suffering is a part of life and can be a useful tool; be aware of the things you are feeding yourself, both physically and spiritually; maybe create some sort of goals in a written format that you can regularly go over to keep you motivated and help you manifest; learn to love exercise, stretching and breathing; possibly explore some creative endeavours; be kind to yourself etc. (the list goes on). Over the past 6 years, I have sporadically tried to form healthy habits based off of the latter values and techniques, thus attempting to take responsibility for my own happiness, however, with each consequential failure, the more hopeless I am becoming - it has gotten to the point where I am doing the bare minimum, just to pay for rent, leaving me financially exhausted with little room and/or energy for healthy activity.I have also sought help for GP's and got in touch with a couple of psychologists - GP's have given me medicinal options, which have either proven to be unsuccessful for me in the past, or risk the danger of becoming heavily addicted, for example, to benzo's (I have a very addictive personality and have had ongoing issues with substance abuse, namely alcohol and marijuana). I have found therapy, so far, firstly to be difficult to attain, and secondly more homeworky (mood journals, document sharing, technique applications etc.) than is useful for me - this is my own fault for not properly following their advice, but it just has not been resonating with me.I feel like I have a lot to offer, but am having difficulties finding where I may apply myself. I do not care for money, to the point where it is reckless, but I would like to find a vocation where I am fulfilled. Because I have no certifications or qualifications, the roles that I am able to work are generally hospitality based, physical labour, or just general shit kicking - this does not cut it for me, and I find the little work I am performing, I am performing utterly miserably, spending most of the time in my head, cursing myself. I cannot sustain a lifestyle like this - I am in desperate need of money, but more desperate need of fulfilment. I am so lazy, but I am exhausted. I suppose I am looking for any thoughts out there, even may they be alternative and outside of the box. I am aware that this is not an isolated issue, so I suppose it is important for me to find insight in community.Be this a very broad explanation, it is the best I can surmise of my emotional state, for now.

"I will make it short, it is late for me.I absolutely love school and other activities, I am (kind of) the ""popular kid"" in school, teachers love me since 1st grade, I have never been in a fight and always get good notes, I am smart, talk a lot and even offered myself as a teacher.And now, what is the problem? Well, I will try to make it even shorter.I am the only son of my family, I have no brothers... well, I have got two siblings, but they almost never come close to us unless they need money for spending in some shit instead of studying, so that leaves me as the only one in the house, and, to be honest, I always fantasize about having a sister that comprehends me and that loves me (as a brother, fcking obviously), that would care about my problems, that would help me in my life and that would talk to me, but the only thing I have is a dog that is too old to go for a walk.To add information to what is above, I always wanted a real friend, someone who is there for me, for talking or hanging out, someone who likes the same things as me and does not ignore me, like many friends I have, when I want to talk, all they do is ghost me...To finish this thingy, I recently fell in love with someone, a very cute girl, shy, likes almost the same things as me, she is perfect for me, I evem walked with her to her home once, and she liked it, I am planning to talk privately with her to compliment her, and try to demostrate that I want her to be 'more than a friend', But I am afraid, afraid of scaring her, afraid of being alone with no love...The reason why I am posting this here is because no one'd listen, no friends of mine would keep a conversation about this without ghosting me, this is my only place to open up to some people. Feel free to trash me in the replies if I did or said something stupid. Goodbye. Even if I am surrounded with people, I feel absolutely lonely.",Depression
"Sorry if the post is not in order/detailed I am tired and I just keep revising what I write in the post the more I think the harder it is to get out I am mainly just putting out what comes to mind at the momentI've felt been way for around 7 years now but I have never really had the motivation to make a post about it I am unsure of what to do.So I experience anhedonia daily I just mostly feel numb without being sad unless I start thinking about my appearance and other things in my life. I can a hard time remembering things/learning and being motivated to get certain stuff done. Also I have an anxious tic that makes me jerk my neck when I am around people for more than a minute. I feel somewhat apathetic when it comes to dealing with other people emotional connections are and are not really there but I still feel very lonely sometimes and its hard to talk to other people. I have tried catting to people on reddit and apps but I just end always up getting ghosted so I have pretty much given up on doing that since its just going to go down to the same dead end road.I find it hard to return calls to cousins who just want to talk or check up on me.I just sit in my room 24/7 playing video games all day,watch videos, etc to just pass the time so I can go to sleep. I only leave my house to drop off packages after people buy cards from me on ebay. I have tried going on walks, picking up new hobbies, playing with the family puppy,etc nothing has really made me feel happy just make the day end faster.My mom keeps asking me when I am going to get a girlfriend and that she wants grandkids she says it occasionally it feels kind of insulting to me. She tells me that I am handsome,etc when I am a fat dude and a below average face with mental issues.I want to get multiple cosmetic surgerys which I am saving up for with the cards that I am selling and with a job I can possibly get if my interview goes well. Getting that done would definitly boost my mental health espeically when it comes to meeting people irl.I have not talked to my mom about it but I am sure she would not be ok with the idea of someone cutting my face open and moving things forward/placing things.I have been trying to lose weight for the past year but I have gained it all back due to a recent event which makes me just want to shut in even moreLate at night on March 30th I tried with my rifle by shooting myself in the heart but I ended up jerking the rifle to the left and accidentally hitting my sister in the hand through the wall I did not plan anything out did it out of compuslion because of my thoughtsSince that event I have gained around 60-70lbs pretty much most of the weight that I have lost over the year, became more suicidal after I read the report in court they are trying to charge me with attempted murder and accused me of doing it in the hallway, For whatever reason they were blind enough not to see the hole in the wall and they are sending down an investigator to come and take a look at it which is making me feel a little better but still like shit I have never had trouble with the law,etc and my life is possibly being thrown straight down the toilet I saw a therapist through zoom for around a month and talked to him about my problems I no longer see him because he cancelled it after I did not talk about deep issues with him on the last week, I am assuming that is why but he never told me thoughI do not think this is going to get any better for me without taking something to keep me going longer.Is it possible for me to get medications without seeing a doctor in person? I brought this up to my mom one time she cried and we never talked about it again and I do not think she wants me medicatedAgain I apologize if what i wrote is not in order or detailed, or does not make sense just want to get this out while I have some motivation to do it and I am tired.

what is it mean when two separate psych doctors agree that Suicide is a valid option for you. One after working with me considered it for himself as well. The other said in a way she will not go to jail but still clear enough she thought it was probably the right choice.Cuz no one I ever met really got a good defense then oh they should not say that well if they are willing to commute career sepuku and risk life imprisonments over it for someone they have a business relationship and otherwise fully stable and have decade plus time practitioning . They must know something No one risks their own career and life for something their soul is not ok with and not a stranger unless they know they are right or certain about their decision.

My dad met someone on minecraft about ten years ago and long story short, they hit it off, became friends, and started a business together. She lives in australia and we live in the US. she is married with a kid and she is been really nasty to my family. She is in control of every aspect of his life; finances, has camera with audio in the living room of his house (they own it for air bnb together), Gps on him, and has tried to buy the love of my brothers and I. Well for a short period i lived in that house rent free which i appreciate. I got kicked out after a manic episode and have been exerting all my engergy trying to get back into that house and pay monthly rent instead. she is decided that she wanted to create a plan for success but its all under her terms. On day four of taking these meds i realized i do not want to live under her roof. If I am going to pay to live somewhere then it makes more sense to me to spend more on rent elsewhere due to the emotional turmoil she is put me through. I am 21 years old and I think that this is the end of the road for me to try and repair my dad and is relationship. He has let this woman that i just found out hes romantically involved with (which to me makes everything far more twisted) someone who has hurt his family so much. This devastated me so much. I want to know if this is me thinking for myself for once, or an impulsive thing. I have had to live at the house i was r**** in for two months while she decides if i should be allowed back. The reason i was kicked out due to a manic episode was because i wanted to go to the hospital for inpatient because i had not gotten a wink of sleep in nearly a week.

"It has been a few months passed since my last entry on this reddit. My art project did not went as expected and my relationship with my model will not go for a very good place... I tried different projects to see If could find something where I could surely prove my talent, and although I may have found something, it is just simply not enough. Every moment of victory is simply a distraction to my own insignificance, it does not matter if I find a job, managed to make an incredible artwork; in the end I am still alone, unsuccessful and unhappy. And seeing people around with your age winning and being happy is just too much. I am done, my envy and shame cannot take it anymore and I already accepted that it is too late to fix things, if there is something to fix right now it will not be enough.

I know my death will bring them misery, but hopefully my suicide note (that at this point has became a manifesto) will ease their pain, it will not make it go away, but it may help them to make the grieving process quicker...

"I have been in and out of feeling suicidal for a few years. Feeling suicidal as in creating a plan, practicing that plan, waking up most days wanting to go through with it, seeing items and thinking about how I could use them to off myself, and so on. I have spent two years with a therapist going over trauma,anxiety, depression, and everything that goes with it. there is been times that I have felt the light shine through, like I was able to work past the bullshit and experience reality in its real form. But I am once again in the low, and once again, it hurts like a motherfucker. Its worse with each major low and each time I feel like I lose another piece of myself. At this point I feel like a husk of who I once was. No drive, no happiness, no goals, just basking in self loathing. It sucks and its no way to get past what I am feeling, but I am trapped in this mindset. I no longer feel remorse for who I leave behind. I know the pain is immeasurable for those who have to suffer the loss of a loved one, especially from suicide. So much greater than my personal hurt but I am fed up. I am fed up with the person who stares back at me in the mirror. Its pathetic watching myself move through the days.

"I am severely traumatized and in the lowest throes of depression. I could fill a book with experiences that would horrify the average person. It is truly remarkable that I am alive, and life is something that I hate to no end. This is a trigger warning, because even though I would probably despise you, I respect your membership in a ""moral community."" I am going to vent some things that contribute to my depression. do not read it, straight up. To preface, I am not some 14 year old kid struggling with new emotions. I am 31, and I have experienced pretty much exclusively low points throughout my life, interspersed with extensive, mind-destroying misery that nearly killed me several times. I am convinced, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that 99% of humanity is sinister in nature, and wicked in their actions. I hate you, very genuinely. My entire being is consumed by an unquenchable hatred for my fellow human being. I was not always like this, though. I was a nice kid with a big, loving heart, even though my parents were meth head trailer trash. My innocence was systematically stolen from me over the course of my early years. I learned to hate, and I eventually lost my ability to trust other humans on any level. I literally cannot maintain any relationships, and I live in complete isolation, waiting to die. I had early childhood issues with abandonment that made me feel like everyone was going to suddenly leave me. I was not wrong. People are shit, and they will stick around as long as you have something that they want. You, the person reading this, are like this. No matter what you think about yourself, you are not loyal to anyone but yourself, and you probably do not even know it. Only broken people can truly understand the ramifications their actions can have on others, because they were once victimized by another's selfishness - their willingness to use you to attain a need or desire of some kind. In order to *truly* understand that, you have to have experienced trauma. Real trauma. Not ""I got a spanking when I was 10."" The kind that actually fucks you up forever. *trigger warning for people who cannot validate my experience, while simultaneously expecting their own experiences to be validated* You, at the grocery store, staring at my ragged clothes and greasy hair, please go fuck yourself. Leave me alone. Mind your own goddamned business. You, in the car trying to run me off the fucking road while you text on your cell phone, I hope you crash and your car bursts into flames. You, neighbor, slamming your fucking fist on the wall whenever I walk across my house - whenever you do this, I have a panic attack. I imagine gruesome things about you, and all that separates us is a paper thin wall that I could crush through with my bare hands. Fuck you. If you knew my thoughts, you would move. You, the guy who stole my car a couple months back. I hope terrible things happen to you in prison. You, the employer who stole thousands of dollars from me and my employees while I managed your company and literally kept it afloat through 2020, I hope your fucking business goes under and your family goes hungry. Fuck you. I hope your mansion burns down. I could go on forever. I despise you all with all my soul. I just had to say some of this.

"I suffer from severe depression, anxiety and mild OCD (alongside symptoms of PMDD but it is hard to get a diagnosis; my psychiatrists are male). The purpose of this post is not to ask what treatment would necessarily work in my case, rather to ask if there is still hope to find an anti-depressant that will remove my paralysing symptoms (low mood, constant fatigue, executive dysfunction, etc). My overarching issue is that I find it increasingly difficult to study for my upcoming GCSEs and I understand that my grades are not worth my mental wellbeing but I live in an emotionally and sometimes physically abusive household with parents that might just marry me off if I am unable to escape by studying abroad; I need to study if I want to be emotionally stable and independent in the future. Though it seems the drugs I have been on (Paxil and Lexapro) never seem to help enough, they might make me able to get out of bed and have the energy to socialise on mediocre to good days but I cannot put myself to work and critically think (I also need constant distractions or my obsessions/intrusive thoughts get the best of me) as to study. Has anyone had a similar experience where the use of another antidepressant has helped them to work long enough to fulfil their responsibility as an employee/student? Should I stop searching for help in antidepressants- is this a dead-end?TL;DR: If neither Paxil nor Lexapro work for me, a 15-year-old, is it worth it continuing to search for antidepressants that do? I am 15(F) and neither Paxil(25mg) nor Lexapro(15mg) have been working",Depression

"First off, I was in there with a guy who stayed 3 extra days because the psych forgot to give him his heart meds and switched him to Seroquel to see if his dizziness would go away. The dizziness was from her accidentally forgetting to give him his meds. That should be enough to tell you how neglectful these places are.When I was 18, I called the hotline. I said I did not want to hurt myself but needed hell. A cop knocked on my door while I was in the bathroom and took me to an ambulance ($250 fee) and then to the hospital (got a bill that hopefully was covered by insurance) and spent 24 hours on a gurney before they decided I was not a danger to myself or others and let me go. The day after my 22nd (July 2nd) I was on a multi-day alcohol bender and attempted (pills). Cops showed up and I was not compliant (kept telling them to leave me alone) and they kept questioning me and standing there. Apparently they were afraid of me ODing but did not bring in an EMT. Eventually they put me in handcuffs without even saying ""you have to come with us or we will put you in handcuffs"". They also came in through the side door and unlocked front garage door which I am pretty sure is illegal. Outside I remained compliant but kept asking why I was in handcuffs. The guy cop then frisked me and touched my penis twice and after he did that I said ""you just touched my dick again"" and then he put his finger up my ass. I am serious. He degraded me in front of my entire neighborhood in broad daylight. 0 reason to. Then they put me in the backseat of a squad car and I kept asking why I was in a car in handcuffs and kept repeating I am not going to harm anyone and they said ""because you told us to fuck off like 20 times"" and ""we are doing what is your best interest"". Riiight, not rushing me to the hospital...? I think I might have been illegally detained because I did not commit a crime or make any threatening gestures and the sodomization was 100% illegal.Eventually they decided maybe the kid overdosing needs medical help so they had me get in the EMT, and they strapped me to a gurney. I have no idea why they did this because I was not fighting at all or acting like I was a danger. I kept asking and they would not give me an answer. Eventually I made it to the hospital. I had my blood drawn a total of five times. I waited in the ER for 5ish hours and then got sent up to the floor for people that attempt and act out and whatnot and it was AWFUL. Close second to jail, I assume. One room with nothing to do and nothing in it, shit food, a hallway leading to two TVs and a group room where you spend 2 hours a day max. No counselors, social workers are there but rarely see you (saw mine on the 5th day, was supposed to be every day), and a psychiatrist sees you every morning for only 5-10 mins.I told them that I was a prescribed Xanax addict over and over and over again and they would not give me my prescription to help with withdrawals. Withdrawals from Xanax and alcohol are extremely dangerous and can kill you. I had two seizures in there. They gave me Ativan after my first seizure ""well, just let us know if you have a seizure"" and for the next few days none of the nurses knew what was going on, or the psych. I kept telling them about my withdrawals and they said ""you are not going through withdrawals, it is a benzodiazepine, it is the same thing"". I was crying, I felt so defeated and that I would die in there. If you know how benzo W/Ds feel, you know what I am talking about. Severe psychological distress and physical pain. 3 days in I lost control of my arm, my back was arched and lost control of the muscles in my face. I could only whisper and this nurse laughed at me and walked away. She also told me my convulsing (felt like my back and neck were about to snap) was just a panic attack and I needed to relax. I had a seizure on the floor and the nurse said ""if you flop on the floor like that, I am not going to give you any benzos"".The patients were also traumatizing. It was awful. Just imagine a psych ward, it is just how you think it is. Met a pedophile, a violent methhead, a tiny meth girl who would masturbate on the phone all day, a couple fucking, violence between patients and security/police, emergency calls, etc. and yelling all the time. did not sleep more than 3 hours a night after I got a new doctor (because my psych forgot to see me one morning) and he was more or less like ""what the fuck are they doing?"". I want off Xanax so bad but it is so difficult to kick and I am so paranoid and anxious and this experience added a layer to my PTSD and my paranoia and anxiety are at an all time high. I am so afraid and I am even more depressed. The only good part is that I am coming up on 30 days sober. I feel like I was treated like an animal and I feel... I would usually use a lot of words, but I just feel like a robot. I do not know what to do... guys, be careful Guys be careful with the hotline and do not ever end up in a psych ward, even voluntarily",Depression
"Depression sucks, I think we have all established that at this point. I want a hobby. There are so many things on my life that I get mildly interested in. I spend weeks dwelling on how to begin a hobby before eventually losing interest on even starting ot convincing myself that I am not going to do good at it so why bother. Or, if I am lucky, I try it, and enjoy it (looking at you crochet) and then lose interest in two days. I want to learn Spanish and now would be the perfect time to learn it. Where I work we have a lot of Spanish speaking customers, and a lot of my coworkers speak Spanish. I could get a lot of practice, and there is no better time to learn it than now. Except my brain is so stupid. I feel so stupid, I cannot remember anything, or focus on anything for any amount of time. Not only that, but I am also terrified of saying something stupid, or looking like an idiot. To be fair to myself it takes years to learn a language, but I have such a thin skin right now. Yesterday I went for a walk around my neighborhood. It was actually the first time I walked around it in a long time. Nearing the end of it I got whacked in the face by a bee, jumped, swatted it. Right in front another person. I felt ridiculous, like I was swatting at nothing like a crazy person. Trying to save I face I remarked that ""I hate bees"" with an awkward laugh. She awkwardly chucked and walked away. Instead of being proud of myself for going for a walk alone I spend that rest of the day feeling like a dumbass. I do not hate bees at all, bees are lovely little pollinaters who help the planet, but now this women on my neighborhood might see me again and think that I am the crazy chick who hates bees.I want to backpack Europe one day. And I keep thinking that I am never going to do it. I am worried about it being another regret in my life. I could have done it but never did. Just another causulty of my depression.I want to go on more hikes. I want a friend to do it with. I love walking but I do not like going on walks by myself. I am still nervous about it, and honestly it is better having someone there with you. I do not want to talk the entire time, but it would be nice to have company while strolling along and listening to music.Speaking of music. I have so many albums on backlog that I have not listened to yet. I want to listen to them, but I like listening to new albums the whole way through on the first go. So I save them until I am ""ready"" and ""have enough time to thoroughly enjoy them"", but that never happens even though a majority of my time is spend in my room doing nothing. I have not learned to drive yet. I have tried and I am scared. I feel like my anxiety is going to because me to over react and because an accident. it would be great to drive, then maybe I could go out and do things. But the thing is that not driving should not be holding me back this much. I do not need to drive where I live. Sure, it would make life easier, but there are plenty of busses or Ubers and even trains that I could take into the city if I wanted. But I do not. I go to work, I do some schoolwork, then I sleep and maybe I will eat if I am lucky while convincing myself that maybe next week things will change.My last semester of college is going be this fall and I feel like my entire world is crumbling because I do not know what I am going to do when it ends.I am overwhelmed, and I am bitter and irritable and angry and judgemental all of the time.

"I am eighteen and just recently had been kicked out of/moved out of my household with nowhere to go. I was at my highest point, hanging out with friends at six flags and enjoying my time. For the first time in a while, I was genuinely happy. It all vanished the moment my mothers boyfriend called to cuss me out/ mother refused to understand my pleas for respect. I know this seems minuscule, but imagine 18 years of a lack of empathy and emotional understanding. 18 years of your life without break. The toll it takes on a human? I have always been pushing back my suicide for another day, another year, for when life gets good. My biggest motivator in going on was the future. But that subtle reminder told me all I needed to know. I was set up for failure by those who were made to love me, the fact that I was never loved, done wrong multiple times, and there is no way of escaping it. No way of turning back the time. Even if I get rich, married, even live my dream life, Ill always be haunted by everything that is happened to me. Ill always be haunted by the fact that I have failed in some way...some aspect. I am fucked emotionally and while I forgive and love some of my family and the people in my life , I will never forget them for staring at a child in the face and deciding to allow what happened to them. To look at my blatant cries for help and turn a blind eye simply because it was not convenient for them. I do not want to wait for the good to happen because its always fleeting. Every time I am in a good place, wether it be 1 second or 1 year; Ill always have the eerie feeling that creeps up on me...reminding me that a traumatic and bad experience is just right around the corner waiting to strike. I cannot be happy without sadness wishing to steal the spotlight. Its hopeless and there is really nothing I can do about it. I do not want to live like this anymore. I do not want to grow old. I do not want to settle for a life of unhappiness just to prevent the temporary hurt of the few that care for me. Id rather bite the bullet and die now so I do not end up 45, wishing I had done it sooner, but being trapped because of those around me. I am young and relatively free so why not now? do not get me wrong, I love my close friends, my sisters, my father, maybe even my mother...but I think they will be okay with me being gone after the initial period of grief. I think my suicide would maybe even bring them closer/help them. I hope so. And if it does not then the blame is on me. I wish it was not this way, but it is.I am at a friend house currently and waiting to inevitably get dropped off at my mothers boyfriends house. When I am home Ill either turn around and run into oncoming traffic/jump off a high rise building. Or take a shitload of pills after getting yelled at for a final time so I can end up being one last inconvenience for my mother and her life. So those that traumatized me can watch me die and see the blood on their hands, and maybe finally Ill be heard. But that would be asking too much. I just want to die. I do not want to feel anymore. I will not have to feel anymore.To those reading and wishing to do the same. do not. Stay alive. Please have more care for yourself and do not end up like me. Take this as a cautionary tale.

Everything still feels the same no matter what med, new routine, holistic solution, etc. I am exhausted of living. So, in March of 2020, I attempted suicide. I lived alone in a nice apartment; I locked the door to my suite, flipped the security latch, taped a handwritten DNR sign in my living room, locked the door, and I took an uncountable amount of Clobazam (not Clonazepam, different drug), 100 Gravol pills, and at least 50 nighttime Benadryl pills. I got into bed and listened to Strict Machine by Goldfrapp. Then, a feeling Id never felt before I was done. I felt like Id finished life. It was so soothing. It also could have been the effects of the massive quantity of pills I took. My then-girlfriend called me, and we have a fine conversation. This is where I black out. She tells me days after my failed suicide attempt what happened. I was completely coherent, and then just stopped talking. This is when I passed out. Long story short (too late), I wake up two days later in intensive care. Tube in my throat to regulate breathing. Catheter definitely in. Guess my DNR did not work. My parents (who live four hours away) are sitting around me as I come to. Fast forward, I convince everyone I am not crazy and they say maybe you should go to our psych ward and I said no, I will get better care when I move back to the city.

I continue to comply with the Ministry of Transportation to get my drivers license back. They keep sending me different forms to get my doctor to sign. My depression/anxiety stays the same.

"What can we say about the "" Unresponsive""? Do they leave us in the dirt because they have no answers? Do they leave us in the dirt because they are not capable of grasping what we are experiencing? Or are we turning their life upside down because we CHOOSE to explain to them what we are experiencing? Ghosting is the easiest thing to do when you want to avoid responsibility. So, what does that say about our counterparts.. the one's we vent to and supposedly trust but leave us in the dust.. What does that say about them.. they would rather experience ignorance than the truth. Our example leaves them render-less to what life is actually all about. it is easier to live your normal pathetic slave ridden life than it is to recognize that someone you care about is suffering and there is nothing they can do about it.. and that is why they ghost us.. not because they do not care.. but because they are inadequate, they are not the one's to solve our problems, we are. The sooner we take responsibility for our depression and loneliness; and even suicidal ideation, who can we trust but ourselves? How many times are you going to have to get hurt until you realize it""s just you, you experiencing it all. All outside conversation is speculation. THE UNRESPONSIVE",Depression
They were given back in cruel manner. I say I am falling in love with them. I then recieve messages from randoms they have messaged without any indication of relationship.

"I am a college student who is currently doing a summer of research. One thing I learned from the very first moment I entered college is that my brain completely shuts down if someone is not kind to me. If someone slightly disrespects me, or talks to me in a condescending way, or even does not say you are welcome after I say thank you, I get extreme depression and anxiety, and my brain shuts down to the point where I cannot even add one and one. I had an incident with my PI about five days ago. He was working in the chemical hood when I asked him if I could come in at 5:00 PM the next day because I had plans. He asked if I knew what to do tomorrow, and I told him not exactly. He then proceeded to tell me to write a two-page protocol with all the calculations as well as every step of the experiment calculations. When I asked him how to do the calculations, his response was ""figure it out"" in a very condescending way. This was my first time ever asking him if I could come in late, so I do not know why he was mad at me. I wanted to come in late because I wanted to shadow a physician during the day. The entire night after my interaction with him, I could not decide on either to cancel my shadowing appointment, or just go there and let my PI pissed. I spent a couple of hours watching a video of him doing the experiment to his work and wrote a three page report. I then emailed him another question, and he did not reply the whole night. He usually replies very quickly, but he did not this time. I was extremely anxious and had no one to talk to about it, so I could not even get a good night's sleep. In the morning time, after waiting for my friend who lives in a different country to pick up the phone, I told her everything and she told me to go to the research. I texted the physician I was supposed to shadow briefly explaining why I could not come, and he was very understanding. So after showering and all, I went to my research, and at around 10:00 AM, my PI emailed me saying that he could not come to lab until evening time. He did this after I emailed him a couple of hours later that I cancelled my plan, and that I was going to come to lab. He said that something happened in his biostatistics class (yeah he is a graduate student), so he cannot come in until the evening. So now I am sitting in the office after I cancelled my shadowing experience and not doing any lab work. There were multiple times I was tearing up. I could not call my family because they live in a different country. I was really pissed the whole day, and after such a long day, he comes in with his flip flops at 6:30 PM and starts doing a 10 minute thing to his research. The amount of anger, frustration and sadness I felt was unbearable. Now I have been feeling depressed the whole week and I cannot even do any work because of it. I literally cannot get myself to get out of bed and submit one thing one click away. I did not get out of my dorm the whole weekend and did not shower up until a few hours ago. People because me so much pain. Many people are nice, but do not have good hearts, and that hurts me the most. I want to grow out of this without losing faith in humanity. I want to be a loving person, but how can you love those who are difficult to love. How do I get emotionally resilient? I really need help. When will I grow up and handle my emotions? I want to be emotionally strong",Depression

"The guy I (21F) like has been severely depressed for almost two years now. There have been times he completely blocked everyone out of his life. Now he is slowly getting better (meds and lots of therapy) but he is still very much depressed. I am always the one having to text first or arranging a walk for example. And even then he would be like: sorry i am too tired. Or Hmm maybe one day, but rn i simply do not care.Its ok. I understand. Most of the time.But sometimes i breakLast time he was drunk and suddenly started sending me snaps. (he never liked drinking and he is a real nerd. Its nothing like him to drink. Besides it influences his meds). So i got mad. I texted him that he is being childish (which he is) and that i would leave if he kept acting like this, because i do not recognize him anymore (i believe this personality switch is caused by his meds?).He is involved in self-destructive behavior. And his psychiatrist does not really tell him to stop doing stupid shit. His psychiatrist would be like: do whatever you like. So my problem: I am tired. I did many things for him: make a giant surprise box, two selfmade depression journals, drag him to the library with me, gave him summaries of classes, defend him around our friends, take him for walks, kept texting him.But Sometimes i break, and i hurt him. I know it makes him feel worse. Its because sometimes I simply do not understand why he hurts me so much. Why he can never truly say thank you for everything.I want to make an appointment with a therapist myself. To ask what depression really is and what i can do. How i can handle his emotionless state. And what i should not do. And i want to ask the guy i like if he thinks that is a good idea. (He already knows i read books about depression etc).He does not really talk about the way he feels. And tends to act funny all the time. I knw its fake. I even told him that. But for some reason he told me he does not know how to stop it and be himself.I also want to show him this sub.Any opinions about this? Or maybe suggestions? I feel guilty and frustrated all the time. My friends even tell me i am a clown for texting him. I know its not true.

I think that it is time for me to go. My family is the only thing that gives me pause. I cried as I pet my dog today but he was happy as could be. Sometimes I wish I was just a brain-dead idiot who could happiness in just simply existing. I figure I should write letters to my friends to let them know why and that they are better without me. I do not matter in the grand scheme of things so why stay here for people to bitch about politics all the time and argue over ridiculous stuff.

I do not believe in anything and accept how they are and what they believe in but they still want me to be a certain way.

I literally brought this upon myself and it sucks. I mean, in high school, this is what I did. I boxed everyone out and only one person cared enough to stay. I thought I was happier then but no longer is it good for me. it is really just over. It really is. I burned those bridges and now I regret it but what am I going to do?

And chances are, almost no one will care. I am not thinking about ending my life, and I am in therapy, but right now I am just working through trauma. This pain I am feeling feels endless and I only have a void inside to work with. I feel like I have lost all that I am. All that I was. Like I do not even stick to my motivation anymore. I definitely deserve this. When you make bad choices you have to live with the consequences. But it makes me feel empty. Like I am a horrible person. Like all my trauma weighs heavily. I cannot help but call myself terrible. I cannot help but insult myself. What am I supposed to do? Nothing. I do nothing. I leave all these people behind and I try again like I always have. I will be hurt for a while but eventually a new group will take me in only for me to abandon it. The times of happiness are getting shorter. From 4 years to 2 to less than a year and I already messed up. it is over man. Why try anymore. All I do is hurt people. I deserve no sympathy. I deserve no kindness. Someone who acts like me deserves nothing good. Can I even blame them for treating me like this? No. I wished for this and it came true. Jump onto the next train and hope and pray that maybe this next time I will stop sabotaging my own happiness. How am I supposed to care? Quick answer, I am not. No one can care about me. it is just over. Again, not ending my own life. Never will. Just living in a void and it is staring back. No smirk, no smile, no frown. Just nothing.

But in the past couple of months I have never felt more of an urge to be suicidal or because harm to myself then I have in the past two years. From 19 to 21 has been a absolute horror. I have gone through so much emotional stress I am pretty sure that I am clinically depressed I have been dealing with it on my own for a very long time now. I know my mindset is very dangerous I am such a talented and strong and smart individual I often times get disappointed with myself for wanting to end my life. But my depression and sadness is so overwhelming at times no matter what people say things never get better. Not to mention my family does not necessarily see the reasons for my distress. So fixated on my ever gleaming future they seem to forget that I have been sitting in the same spot for the past two years depressed lonely I always wondered what it would be like to have sleeping problems but I guess now I know. If this is hard now why would I want to continue life so it can get harder I train physically to try and give myself something to focus on and now that is not even enough I am being ridiculed for being too muscular I cannot find a boyfriend because I am too intimidating and lonely I have no friends well none that are genuine anyway and that upsets me because I am a genuine person and they say the remedy to all of this is time but I do not want to wait any longer. I do not think I can Last straw,Depression

"When the pandemic started, I found myself without a job. Having also withdrawn from a practicum program which I was in to become a teacher (withdrew due to receiving abuse from a supervisor; I have no more passion for teaching kids), I started 2020 with the hope that I can find a better career, a full-time 9-5 office job hopefully. Pandemic turned this all around. I only have a part-time job and self-employment gig. A good thing is that the employer likes my work and gives me more hours and responsibilities, but I am unsure if my job field is suitable for me in terms of income and stability. I do not even know the full reality of this job (adult education), since we have not gone back to an in-person setting yet. After I find out more, I can decide to go back to school to get more credentials. I tell myself, ""let us wait until September when we go back in person"" and ""let us wait until I successfully finish this project next year so I can leave a good impression,"" but I am 25, and I just feel so behind. Just so behind because at this age, I have not even decided my career, have no full-time job, and most of all, still live with my family. I feel like an adult baby. Since the job is remote, I am stuck at home most of the time. It is so boring but most of all, it utterly feels suffocating to be at home because I am left with my ruminating thoughts filled with self-resentment. I feel so guilty every time when I do my hobbies. I tell myself, ""A loser like me cannot waste time away enjoying hobbies."" After getting vaccinated, I have been doing day trips to escape the dullness of my home and rumination. However, these day trips are just temporary escapes, and I am back to 0 when I come back home. I desperately want to move out (I can afford a room rent with my income), but I just feel so lifeless insideafraid to try anything new. This is different from how I was last year when I was extremely busy. I have no motivation to do anything. After I finish work, I just lay on my bed and use social media that makes me feel worse. I have no energy to go for a walk, let alone do self-improvement. I tried to do CBT on my own but had no energy to continue. I tried to look for a low-cost counsellor, but counselling did not do miracles for me, and I feel hopeless. I just want to escape, but there is no escape. I feel trapped inside. Any advice on coping with this somehow? I have no outlet to discuss this with anyone, so at least it feels good to write it down here. tl;dr - Stuck at home with self-resentment due to my bleak career options. Still living with my family. Feeling no motivation and just lifeless in general. I am stuck in limbo. I have no motivation and hope for the future",Depression

It does not make sense to me because those are my feelings and I have dealt with them pretty heavily for many years, so why do they suddenly seem so overwhelming? I mean they are my feelings, I know them and they have always been there but suddenly I always feel so uncomfortable about them and it is weird when I feel the tears come but then a sense of tiredness comes over me and I cannot cry anymore.

"Dad rejects and refuses to try and understand or help me get through the negative emotions and suicidal thoughts I feel. He guilt trips me and makes me the bad guy all the time even if something is not my fault. Hes recently guilted me into keeping a full-time job and trying to go to college full-time. That means 50-60 hours of my week will be for work and school. I no longer have a social life (besides my gf), I no longer enjoy my hobbies, and just existing in general is actually physically exhausting. My mom died 5 years ago so I cannot talk with her about my issues and my stepmom does not seem to care much. I also got diagnosed with T1 Diabetes 2 years ago and having a chronic illness also makes life physically and mentally painful. So about 2 years ago my dad and I got in a 2 hour argument about how I was feeling mentally and he said You know what? let us just not talk anymore. At all. I know you love me and I love you too but that does not mean we have to like each other! Whenever we see each other well try to be friendly but other than that let us just avoid each other. he legit said that after I told him I feel like he does not try to help me mentally or try to understand how I feel and why I feel that way. He was ready to just kick me out of his life. That tells me he does not actually give a crap about me as much as he says he does.

I was never sure why and still am not, but it is affected me all the same. I was born into a pretty poor family, my parents where under 20, mother was an artist and my father was a soldier. It was accidentally and they ended up splitting up due to the stress. My mum moved to a city in various houses, as she got into relationships with guys. Unfortunately my mum was poor, and had little help for taking care of me, so made a buisness so she could work from home to look after me. The partners she had where all very abusive To me and my mum. About this time school started for me. I had never played with other kids so just did not know how to act. The noise when I went in that classroom was fucking deafening. In my head I felt scared, and just starting crying. I could not control it. Was like that all my first year. Second year came and home life changed a bit but not for the better. My muk started to get very sick. She had very rare heart condition, schone's complex i think it is called. Causes her to have mini strokes and be very fatigued. Of course this kind of broke my mum a but, she was already pressured by all of it before the disease. I became her carer a little at home, getting her food and stuff. Not great but this year I made a friend, started playing with him all the time.

"I get these brief 5 seconds of motivation and hope, I can be like everyone else, stable and successful. Then my brain brings me back to reality, and reminds me of how I cannot. Every time I go to apply for jobs on Indeed or try to write down some sort of plan for the future, I just cannot do it. I physically feel nauseous thinking of having to be strong and try everyday. I want it all to end now. I do not want to build something for myself, I do not want to be successful. I just want to be air or a cloud. I do not like being human. Every time I have cared about someone, I lose them because I can become obsessive. My first crush landed me in the psych ward for 2 weeks because he did not like me back. that is what waiting for me whenever I catch feelings again. I cannot take this pain and I wish not to feel it.

I just want a break from my life and the ability to get out of this mindset or at least prevent it from getting worse. At a hospital, there would be people to help me get better and keep me busy, so I think a mental hospital is the best option.

"Since April 16th, my top-floor apartment has been leaking (the roof needs repairs) so every time it is rained, it has rained in my home. Dirty, rusty, rain water filtered through the rooftop deck/external roof, onto the floors and countertops. I have maintained it with a bucket, a towel, mopping excessively. At one point during the heatwave in late June, the water dripping from the rooftop had found its way into the basement, landing on and corroding my unit's water heater. You want to be stressed out and unable to shower during a heatwave, all the while being billed for rent? Trust me, it blows. In just one spot alone, I have collected at least 2 gallons of dirty water. The rest landed onto the floor and therefore, into the unit below me. My whole living situation has really taken its toll on my mental health. Waking up in the middle of the night to a small noise, and then panicking that the ceiling's collapsed is awful.

"So I met this girl on tinder 1 1/2 years . We became friends with benefits because as an attractive man I run into a lot of women who only likes me for my looks but breaks up with me because my depression is so bad. And to mention between us two I was the more attractive one and she leaned more towards average. I was 22 when we met and she was 18. I enjoyed her intelligence and could look past the obvious difference in attractiveness. She took the time to understand my mental health and stuck by me through my issues. I also help her with her family issues because her father was emotionally abusive and her mother is classified as psychotic but refuses help. As time went on we became increasingly involved with each other romantically and sexually which we both always consented to. My mother kicked me out so I wanted to get an apartment and she offered to be my roommate because she could not handle her father any longer. We finally got the apartment and it was like a dream come true we were always happy and barely argued and had more sex than we could even imagine. We adopted a kitten and I worked over night at Lowes as mst so I could barely stay awake to take care of the chores. And when I would be awake I would finally relax and play the Xbox for a little. She did not have a job and was paying rent with unemployment checks. Once unemployment ended I had to take care of the bills untill she could find a job 2 months later. I helped her start a tarot business and that brought in no where close to the amount required for rent. Though I still supported her even after also paying late fees. So when it comes to my depression and suicidal thoughts its random and the only way Id cope is by making music , gaming and smoking weed. Her grandpa caused me to lose my job because he would always drop me off late even though I was paying him . So I was coping with this failure with my usually vices while she finally was hired . But I did not get the same support I displayed for her when she did not have a job . Music was paying the rent until my song was stolen by bk the rula. So I was in the deepest void that I have ever been in because this apartment was my first attempt at independence. She usually took acid at least 3 times a month for meditative reasons and suggested that I should try it because someone said it helps with depression and self realization. I was skeptical so I did not take it until 2 months later. She planned on taking it at the same time so I finally consumed it. The problem is she did not take hers and went to bed. I did not know this and began feeling the effects. At first it was pleasant and gave me this feeling of joy and an unwavering arousal. But then things took a really bad turn . I owned color changing led lights and the walls felt like they were closing in on me. All i could think about was killing myself; nothing felt real thus convincing me that if I died nothing would matter or be concrete. I started punching myself and trying to rip out my hair. Then for some reason the flashing light got faster and increasingly vivid. I felt as if I was falling into my mattress while dying 1000 different ways in my mind but my thoughts felt like reality. Nothing existed but my sad scarred soul. I finally convinced my broken mind to get up and ask her for help . I was gripping the sheets trying to find something that felt real or I would have surely slit my own throat. Of course the feeling of arousal never left because that was the first reaction I received after consuming the substance. So her being the only woman I was intimate with I always felt comfort in her breasts and she has always consented prior to this incident. So for sum reason while under the influence I felt that her Boob was the most concrete thing in my reality so I held it while being the big spoon. She instantly told me to back off so I got up and left immediately feeling shame loneliness. I felt meaningless and was convinced that I was truly alone and should not exist. I lost my mind in my room until I passed out. The next morning I was finally coming down and was beyond traumatized. I spoke to her and explained what happened but all she could focus on is how she was traumatized from me holding her boob. I reminded her that we shared a bed every other day and that cuddling like that is a normal occurrence because we loved each other and pretty much was dating without a label. She finally seen it from my side and understood how scary it might have been for me. She held me and told me she was sorry and that she should have noticed what was going on.she offered to have sex to make me feel better but I declined because I am not into sexual pity. Also my depression has extremely increased since I have took the acid. The next morning I woke up and she was gone. She just abandoned the apartment and left me with the cat and half of my property was locked in her room. She did not come back until the last day and told everyone in my family and her friends that I sexually assaulted her. I was hurt and confused because I was left with a kitten and was losing my apartment that I worked so hard for. I paid for everything in there all she owned was a few things in her room. And to say I sexually assaulted her is a defamation to my image and character because I have never forced myself upon her .so I was angry , heart broken and betrayed so I attempted suicided by slicing down my wrist with a razor and the razor was pretty much half way lodged into my wrist . My mom found me before I could bleed out and rushed me to the er. When I got back home I got into the locked room grabbed all my things and sum evidence (her diary that she started when we first moved in) and left with my kitten. Till this day she will not talk to me and is telling people I sexually assaulted her . Am I in the wrong ? The experience in that room full of lights still replays in my head and haunts me to this day . My friend who was once raped twice in the Dominican Republic says that this situation does not count as sexual . Can anyone give me advice on how to cope or what should I say to her or if I should take legal action? This would have never happened if I did not believe her and took the acid as a cure for depression. I was stupid for being so nave but therapy does not work and I am not up to taking any man made medications anymore . I just wanted to feel normal for once but I ended up feeling worse than when i started.Sorry for any misspelling and grammatical errors. My fwb/roommate betrayed me and claims I sexually assaulted her but I do not think I did, and I still love her. This caused me to lose my first apartment.help!",Suicidal

"My dad always says it is all about perspective. We all have our windows through which we see the world, and our reality is how we chose to perceive it. Sometimes, even the most complex problem just requires a shift in perspective, or a view through another person's window, before it can be solved with ease.I have given up on life. I am not quite sure how to describe it, I guess it is just one of those things you know, like when you are in love, when you are hungry or just need the loo. I suppose the symptoms are easily identifiable: apathy, melancholy, depression, fatigue, lethargy, etc, but there is a less-medical term that I think describes it better: my light has gone out.Who I am does not really matter, though for completeness's sake my executive summary details are: 21 Male, 2nd Year Engineering student from South Africa, caucasian with Danish and English ancestry, single, always have been, probably on the spectrum, no friends anymore.I have buried my best and closest friend, and another four friends over the past five years. I have been wrongfully accused of a crime that I never committed, which took the system a year of intimidation, court rooms and sever depression and anxiety to determine that she had made it all up. I have been a victim of extortion, blackmail and cybercrimes, involving intimidation, fear and had no one to talk to. I am the eldest of three, and the eldest of my family's generation and link that keeps my stressed-out family together. I have felt the feeling of loving another, but never the feeling of it being mutual. I was once a happy child in a happy house with a dream of changing the world, and the aptitude to do it. But today, I do not see the point of it all. My friends are dead, the person I am in love with, and the only person I have every loved, does not feel the same way. I have horrors tormenting me each night that I cannot tell anyone about, I am half way through second year and I have only been on campus for four weeks before lockdown, I do not have much money, I have lost focus on studies altogether and I am only 21 years old.Perspective. The only thing my sorry engineering mind could come up with was getting a different perspective on things, and maybe, just maybe I might find a path that will lead me to, well, enlightenment (i.e. to get the light back).You obviously do not know me from a bar of soap, but maybe I need impersonal advice, I do not know.

"I really do not understand why I find myself here, suicide is not something I have ever attempted, but it is something I have considered and started considering more and more as time goes on now that I have graduated college.The worst part is I do not think I have any good reason to do it. I am successful in a very well-paying career. I am fairly smart and can apply myself. I am not hot by any means but I am attractive enough to have fairly good options on the dating apps (more on this later). I have a loving, if not smothering family (also more on this later), and a good amount of close online friends and some IRL friends that I still talk to online. I have long-term goals for myself that I want to see happen. It may seem that I have no right to be here, and fuck maybe I do not, but I am still absolutely fucking miserable and some days I wonder why I have not blown my brains out yet. Today's one of those days, for some reason.It really just comes down to my inability to form intimate relationships. I do not really date anymore, for me to be close enough with someone and like them enough to have sex with them is rare since moving back home. I also still live with my extremely obsessive parents in a pretty remote area which makes meeting new people super difficult. All of this leaves me feeling so isolated and behind from everyone, and I am terrified to make any change in my life that could somehow fuck me up worse than where I currently am. Yeah I could afford to rent somewhere but what if that ends up making me more lonely while also burning thousands a month?Work keeps me occupied but the thoughts of ""you are never going to meet someone, get married, have a family, be successful outside of working a 9-5 job, what is the point of you still being here, you will never find more friends and just like some of your college ones the rest will disappear as time goes on"" are getting more and more frequent. it is something I have considered",Suicidal

I did not realize what the movie was about until it was too late. you would think I would handle it fine (I have been clean for almost a year, and had plenty of support from family/friends and psychiatrists) but damn I was wrong. It made all the bad memories come back to me. My head became so dark so fast, had no clue what to do. Luckily my girlfriend realized what was going on so she turned it off as soon as possible, and went into comforting mode (she is actually the best). Now that she went home, my head is filled with nothing but dark garbage again, and honestly I have not had this bad of an urge to sh in forever. I do not know if it is called a trauma, but is it normal for stuff to be this triggering? I know I will be fine in a few days, but it kind of upset me that it hit me so bad.

I know that venlafaxine has more noradrenergic effects at higher dosages and was wondering what that usually translates to in terms of how it makes you feel? Is vortioxetine (or fluoxetine) that different of a med that it would be worth tapering off venlafaxine to switch to that?

"I know the knee-jerk reaction is to call cops on people.To my utter detriment, I am 100% sane. There is scarcely any reason or legal grounds to hospitalise me against my will, save for the fact I have been (rightfully, and logically) suicidal for the past 13 or so years.All the cops do is offer disgustingly hollow platitudes, and then leave. Same for suicide hotlines, or therapists, or psych wards. Hot take, but therapy and medication do jack shit when your issues stem from mostly material conditions such as oppression, poverty, loneliness, and long-term (often systemic) abuse.Whenever I have a BPD meltdown - and that is very often - a lot of people opt to either ignore it, or call the authorities. Due to my background of abuse and lapses in memory, I will not trust a one-time ""it will be fine, you can talk to me!"". Alleged friends no longer commit to anything they promise or say in the heat of the suicidal crises. And I realise it is not an obligation. But I willingly subject myself to horrible shit to keep up to date with suicidal people again and again and again, never resting assured I miraculously saved them.Comfort takes time. it is a lost art. Love takes time. As does trust, and henceforth, anything meaningful. I say I do not have friends, having 400+ ""friends"" on FB, as it would be saying you have nutrition if you ate McD for every single meal ever. Comfort takes time. But dialling 112 and never saying a word is easy.What am I venting for then? A lament for the unlovable? Ode to the abandoned? Perhaps simply a reminder to take a long hard look at your real friendships. Check in with people. Pick out the ones you want to commit to, and go balls to the wall, because frankly, some people like me can be saved, but only with a lot of effort.Show up. We might object. Help up do the dishes. Bring groceries when you come. Organise things with solid dates and times. Be stern and uncompromising, but touch us with love when you go in for that awkward hug.There will be obstacles. I do not trust a soul in a 500 km radius, and then there is people I have unrequited feelings for, and then there is America. Distance is a bitch, but you will probably either drink or gamble that money anyway. Gods, please, just show up. I would have paid, for every single trip, I would have paid.But there was no comfort. In the end, there was no one. No easy fixes. So if you are reading this, odds are that you have someone you ought to show up for. Maybe even yourself. I only ever needed comfort, not cops",Suicidal

"I am a (M35) who have been struggling with depression more or less my whole life.What I can remember, is that from the age of 9, I have been an extreme introvert that attempted suicide at many occasions but with the luck or bad luck based on how you look at it never succeeded.For many years I would not talk with people and had a temper that made people frightened and made some enjoy pushing my buttons until I snapped.Disappeared whole school-days and just sat at isolated places considering my options even trying to end it.First time was in a forested area outside my school age 9.Had a rope and decided ""it is time"".Trew it over a large branch and anchored it to another tree. Picked up some rocks to make a makeshift stool that I could stand on.Lost conciousness and woke up 10-15 minutes later with a bleeding wound above my eyebrow and an extrem headache, sore throat and a redness around my neck. The large branch had broken of and hit me in the head and my face got smashed against the rock I was standing on.Went back to school and said that I tripped and there was no need for a check-up.This is my strongest memory from my childhood and many year later it is still something that makes me sad, because no one cared where I was for 1,5 hour age 9.My parents never got told and I will never tell them because it even today would hurt them, my brother knows about that and some other tes as well.I struggled through school at all levels and never connected with anyone because I (according to myself) was ugly, stupid, uninteresting, mean, angry and a horrible person and I made myself that person for years knowing fully aware that I actually was loving, caring, thoughtful, kind and interested in other people's problems.Even after that I would not even try to make connections with other people feeling less than everybody else, still playing the role as the cocky self-important asshole I have made myself up to be.At age 28 i meet a wonderful woman that never gave up on learning to know the real me.She more or less forced herself onto me and I did not stop it because I actually wanted her to break down the wall I have for years built up around myself.She is the most important person in my life but I have had my down periods where I just cannot allow her to see me weak and the latest one I had was today.I am away from my family more or less 5-7 days a week and it hurts but I do it for them so we can afford to still live as we do.But today was painful, I told my oldest son ""dad is going to work"" and he just said ""Bye"" with me kneeling to get a hug and no hug was given.My youngest just waved and then continued with what he was doing and I was totally heartbroken.Walked out to my car with my wife after me and just started to cry feeling like a stranger that just visits the boys mom from time to time.did not allow my wife to touch me became cold towards her.Hated my job, hated life, hated my own existence a d just want my wife to divorce me so that she could be happy and the boys could have someone that is always present for them and not se stranger who comes to visit a day or to each week.As a person that only have my parent, brother and my own family in my circle of life it is hard to find any reason why I should not just fade away from my boys existence even though it selfish and hurtful not just to the boys and my wife but probably the end for me.This sucked and was totally stupid to write.Publish it but will be removed in another 30 minutes or sooner.

I was told that I am strong, but I feel like I am just one awful day to having a bad end. I am losing hope",Depression
i feel like my life is too good for me to be feeling sad and yknow.. suicidal I am too privileged,Suicidal
"I cannot deal with it! I do not want to work a factory job that barely pays me, get abused at home, live in a shitty place with people who hate me....I need help! I want to get out!!! I will hurt myself I seriously cannot stand living this kind of life anymore!!!",Suicidal
I have been feeling like this for weeks and with my social life crumbling my supports have slowly disappeared. Every day i wake up only to want to go back to sleep. only sleep is keeping me away from my thoughts. Lately i have been experiencing alot of looming thoughts of just disappearing and somehow stop this pain....i have tried almost everything from self love to self care and nothing seems to be working... I am feeling so much pain in side,Suicidal
"So I am moving to a different apartment next week, and to be honest, even though moving is a serious pain, it has been one of the best things to happen to me.I have made a decision to get rid of most of the stuff I have, I have basically thrown away 80-90% of the stuff in my current apartment and kept only the basic 10% of stuff that I need. Over the last two weeks, I have spent a lot of time just cleaning up my current apartment and throwing out stuff that I do not need or donating it if it is in good condition. The decluttering has lightened my mind so much. it is like someone has just lifted a huge weight off my head.I have lived here for the last 6 years, 4 of which I have spent in depression and honestly, I cannot wait to get out of this apartment in a couple of days (I move on Wednesday). I am feeling proud of myself for taking and executing this decision to move out (even though I did not need to, as everything was just fine with this apartment otherwise). It really is a much needed change that I am looking forward to. I hope the new apartment brings better luck and better mental health in my life. If you are depressed and feel stuck in a particular place, just try and move if you can. It really helps you to assess what is important to you and what is not, sets you in motion and brings about a much needed change of scenery. it is really good for your brain. Moving to a different apartment is helping me deal with depression",Depression
"I am suicidal asf from grief of brother at 18 and multiple traumas etc. Ik how bad suicidalness is and how strong that desire to kys is. A lotta people maybe would seek therapy as a last resort just to be able to talk to someone in hopes they have advice or just anything on how to go about living, but then you got to pay and then you might not like them or feel like talking to a 30-60 y o person about all their fucked up shit and then find someone you like etc etc If you see this and need someone to talk to feel free to hmu, I am not a therapist, but I am another person that can relate to being suicidal asf and someone who is fully aware of how fucked up it is you do not got to talk to me like I am a professional adult and hold back some of the language or whatever you want to say, just talk to me like I am a best friend who tells everything about to each other cuz if you need someone you do not always want to go thru that professional counselor / therapy seeking journey sometimes you just want someone you can text that you know will understand you and understand that fucking battle of living ur facing every second of each day.Also just a side note I never tried therapy yet i Been wanting to cuz I am that same person I was describing ^ but have not started that journey of finding one and was just thinking all of those things and how it could help but not everyone wants to go through that and if ur on the same page about it then I am right here all for you just text me pls if you cannot find or have anyone Id love to make use out of this terrible reality and given terrible emotions I have lived to help others who are living their worst realities. I wish you all on this reddit page and anyone who is struggling the best I am here for anyone who needs someone Therapy should be free but its not so pls do not hesitate to talk to me or someone",Suicidal
"Throwaway account because my partner follows my main account and it might be compromised too, for reasons I will explain soon.I am 33 and currently in living as an immigrant in a EU country, not my own (I hail from another continent), since 4 years or so with my fianc.I have health issues, both mental and physical, that prevent me from working since about 2 years ago (CPTSD, Clinical depression, burnout, chronic pain due to severe injuries I received), I do not really speak the language here that well, partly because it took me over a year to become ""fluent"" and then because covid happened and I went months without seeing other human other than cashiers at the market or my partner) so I lost a lot of proficiency.I am not saying he is a bad person or that he is isolating me, because he is been doing his best to take care of me. it is just... I have lost so much freedom here, I am unhappy and no one really takes my need for help seriously.I am not in contact with my family anymore because one of my parents is very dangerous, controlling and abused me since my childhood. Like most abusers this parent projects a great public persona and divided the rest of the family in a ""either you support my side or are against me"" so most of my family cut contact with me to prevent drama with my parent. This person has tried to stalk me and threaten me if I speak up on their abuse, to the point of finding people I worked with years ago and using them as messengers.As you might guess I became overprotective of my privacy, I functionally do not have much of a social media presence anymore, take pictures or even talk to former friends much. I also do not have friends here either.I know my parent has stalked and found most of my social media accounts and tried to find my addresses when I move to another place (no idea how they manage to do that but they have even found my landlord info twice in 6 years despite being in another country). Imagine how bad this person is that I moved continents just to get away from them.I have been trying to get therapy here, but my partner thinks it is unnecessary and an unneeded expense. I cannot get treatment for my chronic pain for the same reasons, I cannot even speak of pain killers without being treated like an addict in our house.I probably fucked up coming here and I probably should have never done so I do not have anyone, I do not have friends, or family or anyone that can help me, I have no place to call home or to return to, I just feel so alone and trapped and isolated and I miss human contact so much I do not remember the last time I spoke with another human that was not a cashier. I wish I could escape but where to? there is nowhere.I just keep hearing this voice in my head telling me that if I kill myself I will not have to hurt anymore and I will be able to rest. I might be even lonelier but it might be better, I have not been pain free in so, so long.I am just so afraid of messing up because if I do I know I will face retaliation and things will just, somehow, be worse. Everyday in this prison I see the kitchen knives and wish I could slice and dice myself into oblivion to escape this.I am in France but if you are going to suggest the local hotlines just do not, already tried that a while back and the guy just told me ""this is beyond my level"" and hung on me. I am having intrusive dark thoughts because I am isolated in a country that is not my own and have nowhere to return to",Suicidal

"I struggle with depression since a while. Atthe beginning I had thaught circles as the one discribed down below quite often, but as it continued, it seemed like my brain got to lazy to think them to the end or the thaughts where more straight foreward.I just got flashed again with the thaught ofhow pointles my existence is. The earth, our universe is around since a sooooo long time. And there are more than 7Mi Humans on this planet. Like... My existence does not matter at all.And I am just wondering: how do others deal withtheir pointlessnes of their lifes. Seriously: How?",Depression
I wish I could live in a fictional tv show you know one of those shows where everybody is attractive including myself any problem I have gets solved within a hour. I have great friends that do not back stab me I also have a beautiful girlfriend that holds my hand in public and gives me hugs and kiss all the time. Christmas would be awesome I would not be alone I would be with all of them I also would have a passion job that I love like a lead singer of a band. Anyways... back to reality that soul crushing feeling hits hard knowing that my real reality is a damn nightmare I cannot wake up out of. I wish I could live in a fictional tv show,Depression
"I guess in some ways I am doing better than most. I still have a job - a good job - but... there is just nothing to live for. there is nothing that gives me joy, there is nothing that keeps me going, except habit and not being able to just go buy a gun and end it all. I do not know I have a lot of energy left in me to continue, though. How do you handle it? How do you cope?",Depression
my mom accused me of stealing her drugs again and it makes me so upset because i have not and i do not know why i had to get such a fucked up family and narcissistic mom. I am crying in the bathroom and i can hear her in my room going through my stuff and I am so sick of dealing with this stuff. she just was all nice and asked if i wanted to watch a movie like 10 min ago and now she is mad again. i feel like ill never be able to get out and do what i want to do with my life so what is the point. there is nothing for me. i just wish someone would see how I am doing and help or something but i know that no one will. i feel so stupid and i know ill delete this later I am so sick of this i cannot do it,Depression
"As a quiet person who is dealt with many mental health issues, and is generally stuck inside my own head, I enjoy being quiet, observing a lot and not being a socially obnoxious twat. Why do people act like being quiet is a weird thing? Just annoys the hell out of me and makes me instantly dislike the person, that is all rant over. ""you are so quiet"" is the biggest annoyance ever and makes me want to flip my shit",Depression
